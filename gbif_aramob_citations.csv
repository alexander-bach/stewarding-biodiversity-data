 phylogatR : Phylogeographic data aggregation and repurposing	Bryan C Carstens|Stephanie Crouch|Sydney K Decker|Eric Franz|Jeffery Ohrstrom|Danielle J Parsons|Tara A Pelletier	Molecular Ecology Resources	26.06.2022	2022-06-24T00:00:00.000Z	false	true	DOI		UNITED_STATES	biodiversity informatics|data repurposing|genetic diversity|macrogenetics|open science	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13673	10.1111/1755-0998.13673	f3e87600-b2ae-31c3-a89b-5528352e5527	Patterns of genetic diversity within species contain information about the history of that species, including how they have responded to historical climate change and how easily the organism is able to disperse across its habitat. More than 40,000 phylogeographic and population genetic investigations have been published to date, each collecting genetic data from hundreds of samples. Despite these millions of data points, metaâ€analyses are challenging because the synthesis of results across hundreds of studies, each using different methods and forms of analysis, is a daunting and timeâ€consuming task. It is more efficient to proceed by repurposing existing data and using automated data analysis. To facilitate data repurposing, we created a database (phylogatR) that aggregates data from different sources and conducts automated multiple sequence alignments and data curation to provide users with nearly readyâ€toâ€analyze sets of data for thousands of species. Two types of scientific research will be made easier by phylogatR: large metaâ€analyses of thousands of species that can address classic questions in evolutionary biology and ecology, and studentâ€ or citizenâ€ science based investigations that will introduce a broad range of people to the analysis of genetic data. phylogatR enhances the value of existing data via the creation of software and webâ€based tools that enable these data to be recycled and reanalyzed and increase accessibility to big data for research labs and classroom instructors with limited computational expertise and resources.

A 25,000 year record of climate and vegetation change from the southwestern Cape coast, South Africa	Lynne J. Quick|Brian M. Chase|Andrew S. Carr|Manuel Chevalier|B. Adriaan Grobler|Michael E.

We analysed fossil pollen from a 25,000 year sediment core taken from a near-coastal wetland at Pearly Beach that revealed that distinct changes in vegetation composition occurred along the southwestern Cape coast. From these changes, considerable variability in temperature and moisture availability are inferred. Consistent with indications from elsewhere in southwestern Africa, variability in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) was identified as a strong determinant of regional climate change. At Pearly Beach, this resulted in phases of relatively drier conditions (~24â€“22.5 cal ka BP and ~22â€“18 cal ka BP) demarcated by brief phases of increased humidity from ~24.5â€“24 cal ka BP and 22.5â€“22 cal ka BP. During glacial Termination I (~19â€“11.7 ka), a marked increase in coastal thicket pollen from ~18.5 to 15.0 cal ka BP indicates a substantial increase in moisture availability, coincident, and likely associated with, a slowing AMOC and a buildup of heat in the southern Atlantic. With clear links to glacial and deglacial Earth system dynamics and perturbations, the Pearly Beach record represents an important new contribution to a growing body of data, providing insights into the patterns and mechanisms of southwestern African climate change.

A benchmark dataset of herbarium specimen images with label data	Mathias Dillen|Quentin Groom|Simon Chagnoux|Anton GÃ¼ntsch|Alex Hardisty|Elspeth Haston|Laurence Livermore|Veljo Runnel|Leif Schulman|Luc Willemse|Zhengzhe Wu|Sarah Phillips	Biodiversity Data Journal	12.02.2019	2019-02-08T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI		BELGIUM|UNITED_KINGDOM|NETHERLANDS|GERMANY|ESTONIA|FINLAND|FRANCE		JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.3897/bdj.7.e31817	10.3897/bdj.7.e31817	82eb852f-e548-3eed-8855-cfe2abb8b8da	Background: More and more herbaria are digitising their collections. Images of specimens are made available online to facilitate access to them and allow extraction of information from them. Transcription of the data written on specimens is critical for general discoverability and enables incorporation into large aggregated research datasets. Different methods, such as crowdsourcing and artificial intelligence, are being developed to optimise transcription, but herbarium specimens pose difficulties in data extraction for many reasons. New information: To provide developers of transcription methods with a means of optimisation, we have compiled a benchmark dataset of 1,800 herbarium specimen images with corresponding transcribed data. These images originate from nine different collections and include specimens that reflect the multiple potential obstacles that transcription methods may encounter, such as differences in language, text format (printed or handwritten), specimen age and nomenclatural type status. We are making these specimens available with a Creative Commons Zero licence waiver and with permanent online storage of the data. By doing this, we are minimising the obstacles to the use of these images for transcription training. This benchmark dataset of images may also be used where a defined and documented set of herbarium specimens is needed, such as for the extraction of morphological traits, handwriting recognition and colour analysis of specimens.

Effective conservation management requires more thorough biodiversity surveys that can reveal system-level patterns and that can be applied rapidly across space and time. We offer a way to use environmental DNA, community science and remote sensing together as methods to reduce the discrepancy between the magnitude of change and historical approaches to measure it. Taking advantages of modern ecological models, we integrate environmental DNA and Earth observations to evaluate regional biodiversity patterns for a snapshot of time, and provide critical community-level characterization. We collected 278 samples in Spring 2017 from coastal, shrub and lowland forest sites in California, a large-scale biodiversity hotspot. We applied gradient forest to model 915 family occurrences and community composition together with environmental variables and multi-scalar habitat classifications to produce a statewide biodiversity-based map. 16,118 taxonomic entries recovered were associated with environmental variables to test their predictive strength on alpha, beta, and zeta diversity. Local habitat classification was diagnostic of community composition, illuminating a characteristic of biodiversity hotspots. Using gradient forest models, environmental variables predicted 35% of the variance in eDNA patterns at the family level, with elevation, sand percentage, and greenness (NDVI32) as the top predictors. This predictive power was higher than we found in published literature at global scale. In addition to this indication of substantial environmental filtering, we also found a positive relationship between environmentally predicted families and their numbers of biotic interactions. In aggregate, these analyses showed that strong eDNA community-environment correlation is a general characteristic of temperate ecosystems, and may explain why communities easily destabilize under disturbances. Our study provides the first example of integrating citizen science based eDNA with biodiversity mapping across the tree of life, with promises to produce large scale, high resolution assessments that promote a more comprehensive and predictive understanding of the factors that influence biodiversity and enhance its maintenance.

A cautionary message on combining physiological thermal limits with macroclimatic data to predict species distribution	Mathieu Chevalier|Vincent Pignard|Olivier Broennimann|Antoine Guisan	Ecosphere	19.07.2024	2024-07-19T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	generic_DOIs_provided		SWITZERLAND|FRANCE	climate change|experimental measures|geographic range|physiological niche|realized niche|species distribution|thermal limits	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4931	10.1002/ecs2.4931	93bda9d5-971a-3aeb-9a18-98165ef0a603	Macroclimatic data are widely used to estimate the realized environmental niche of species and predict the current or the future spatial distribution of species. Because the realized niche is a subset of the fundamental nicheâ€”constrained by biotic interactions and dispersal limitationsâ€”proxies of the fundamental niche (e.g., thermal limits obtained from physiological experiments) are sometimes combined with macroclimatic data under the assumption that areas predicted as unsuitable from a realized niche perspective may belong to the species' fundamental niche. However, it is unclear whether this assumption is valid and whether thermal limits can be combined with macroclimatic data. Here, we explored these questions using available physiological thermal limits measured for 151 ectotherms. Specifically, we explored whether physiological thermal limits are larger than observed (realized) thermal limits measured using macroclimatic data, and what would be the effect of considering the physiological niche in addition to the realized niche for current and future predictions. Our results confirm previously raised concerns, as physiological limits can delimit a narrower range of thermal tolerance than the realized niche, particularly at the cold end of the thermal gradient where adaptive and/or facilitative mechanisms could allow species to survive in temperatures below physiological limits. These findings show that combining data on physiological thermal limits with macroclimatic data is dubious and that spatial predictions should be interpreted with caution because data on physiological thermal limits do not fit well with macroclimatic data that do not capture the conditions that organisms experience in the wild. While estimated physiological thermal limits are likely of value to complement species distribution studies, they are likely more useful in biophysical models that account for additional processes including the animal's behavior.

A Conceptual Framework for Choosing Target Species for Wildlife-Inclusive Urban Design	Beate Apfelbeck|Christine Jakoby|Maximilian Hanusch|Emanuel Boas Steffani|Thomas E. Hauck|Wolfgang W.

Current conservation approaches in cities are mostly defensive. Thus, they focus on remnant pockets of natural areas or try to protect particular species that occur in the built environment. These approaches are vulnerable to further urban development and do not create habitats. An alternative strategy is to make wildlife an integral part of urban development and thereby create a new habitat in the built-up area. Here we address the challenge of choosing target species for such wildlife-inclusive urban design. The starting point of our conceptual framework is the regional species pool, which can be obtained from geo-referenced species data. The existing habitat types on and around the development site and dispersal barriers limit the species numbers to the local species potential. In the next step, the siteâ€™s potential for each species is analyzedâ€”how can it be upgraded to host species given the planned development and the life-cycle of the species? For the final choice of target species, traits related to the humanâ€“animal interaction are considered. We suggest that stakeholders will be involved in the final species selection. Our approach differs from existing practice, such as expert choice of priority species, by (1) representing an open process where many species are potential targets of conservation, (2) the involvement of stakeholders in a participatory way. Our approach can also be used at larger spatial scales such as quarters or entire cities.	BIODIVERSITY_SCIENCE	2020-11-24T15:50:58.138Z	0023751-181108115102211

Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning research has traditionally focused on how experimentally controlled species richness affects net primary productivity (S â†’ NPP) at small spatial grains. In contrast, the influence of productivity on richness (NPP â†’ S) has been explored at many grains in naturally assembled communities. Mismatches in spatial scale between approaches have fuelled debate about the strength and direction of biodiversityâ€“productivity relationships. Here, we examine the direction and strength of the influence of productivity on diversity (NPP â†’ S) and the influence of diversity on productivity (S â†’ NPP) and how these vary across spatial grains.  Location: Contiguous USA.  Time period 1999â€“2015.  Major taxa studied Woody species (angiosperms and gymnosperms).  Methods: Using data from North American forests at grains from local (672 m2) to coarse spatial units (median area = 35,677 km2), we assess relationships between diversity and productivity using structural equation and random forest models, while accounting for variation in climate, environmental heterogeneity, management and forest age.  Results: We show that relationships between S and NPP strengthen with spatial grain. Within each grain, S â†’ NPP and NPP â†’ S have similar magnitudes, meaning that processes underlying S â†’ NPP and NPP â†’ S either operate simultaneously or that one of them is real and the other is an artefact. At all spatial grains, S was one of the weakest predictors of forest productivity, which was largely driven by biomass, temperature and forest management and age.  Main conclusions We conclude that spatial grain mediates relationships between biodiversity and productivity in realâ€world ecosystems and that results supporting predictions from each approach (NPP â†’ S and S â†’ NPP) serve as an impetus for future studies testing underlying mechanisms. Productivityâ€“diversity relationships emerge at multiple spatial grains, which should widen the focus of national and global policy and research to larger spatial grains.

This invasive species has been successfully removed from many areas of Europe. In Chile and Argentina there have been only patchily distributed attempts of local control to date and large-scale removal has been considered unfeasible. We analyzed available scientific information, to determine best-fit strategies and improved methodologies that increase efficiency (capture per unit of effort) in American mink control. We reviewed published papers about programs that aimed at local control, functional or total eradication of minks in the Web of Science (WoS) database. Based on accessible information, the influence of some field variables on capture efficiency was determined through a General Lineal Model. From 1525 results in the WoS search, 51 papers refer to mink control action carried out in 28 areas of Europe and South America since 1992. Trapping has been the most used and efficient capture method.  Short  trapping periods  that  cover larger lineal  distances  per control program,  and  the  use  of attractants, specifically pheromones, have led to improved control efficiency. Chilean, Scottish and English experiences showed among the highest trapping efficiency values. We identify areas of research needed on mink ecology and behavior and trapping techniques that could improve trapping efficiency. A control program that incorporates the outcomes of this data assessment has the potential to improve feral mink removal. But further research is required to ensure that these efficiency measures result in cost-effective control in Patagonia.	INVASIVES	2023-08-15T07:52:03.761Z	0040456-210914110416597

This notion has profoundly influenced scientific research and environmental policy. Given recent advances in technology and data availability, however, we are now poised to ask whether ecoregions meaningfully delimit biological communities. Using over 200 million observations of plants, animals and fungi we show compelling evidence that ecoregions delineate terrestrial biodiversity patterns. We achieve this by testing two competing hypotheses: the sharp-transition hypothesis, positing that ecoregion borders divide differentiated biotic communities; and the gradual-transition hypothesis, proposing instead that species turnover is continuous and largely independent of ecoregion borders. We find strong support for the sharp-transition hypothesis across all taxa, although adherence to ecoregion boundaries varies across taxa. Although plant and vertebrate species are tightly linked to sharp ecoregion boundaries, arthropods and fungi show weaker affiliations to this set of ecoregion borders. Our results highlight the essential value of ecological data for setting conservation priorities and reinforce the importance of protecting habitats across as many ecoregions as possible. Specifically, we conclude that ecoregion-based conservation planning can guide investments that simultaneously protect species-, community- and ecosystem-level biodiversity, key for securing Earthâ€™s life support systems into the future.

A machine learning approach for modeling the occurrence of the major intermediate hosts for schistosomiasis in East Africa	Zadoki Tabo|Lutz Breuer|Codalli Fabia|Gorata Samuel|Christian Albrecht	Scientific Reports	21.02.2024	2024-02-21T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI		GERMANY|BOTSWANA	Freshwater snails|Predictor features|Random forest|Schistosomiasis|Sub-Saharan Africa	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-54699-1	10.1038/s41598-024-54699-1	c175f92f-76c0-3cfb-8df9-61b1c39a0f62	Schistosomiasis, a prevalent water-borne disease second only to malaria, significantly impacts impoverished rural communities, primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa where over 90% of the severely affected population resides. The disease, majorly caused by Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium parasites, relies on freshwater snails, specifically Biomphalaria and Bulinus species, as crucial intermediate host (IH) snails. Targeted snail control is advisable, however, there is still limited knowledge about the community structure of the two genera especially in East Africa. Utilizing a machine learning approach, we employed random forest to identify key features influencing the distribution of both IH snails in this region. Our results reveal geography and climate as primary factors for Biomphalaria , while Bulinus occurrence is additionally influenced by soil clay content and nitrogen concentration. Favorable climate conditions indicate a high prevalence of IHs in East Africa, while the intricate connection with geography might signify either dispersal limitations or environmental filtering. Predicted probabilities demonstrate non-linear patterns, with Bulinus being more likely to occur than Biomphalaria in the region. This study provides foundational framework insights for targeted schistosomiasis prevention and control strategies in the region, assisting health workers and policymakers in their efforts.

A new model for efficient, needâ€driven progress in generating primary biodiversity information resources	Alex Asase|Moses N. Sainge|Raoufou A. Radji|Omokafe A. Ugbogu|A.

However, online biodiversity information is biased spatially as a result of slow and uneven capture and digitization of existing data resources. The West African Plants Initiative approach to data capture is a prototype of a novel solution to the problems of the traditional model, in which the institutional â€œownerâ€ of the specimens is responsible for digital capture of associated data. Methods: We developed customized workflows for data capture in formats directly and permanently useful to the â€œownerâ€ herbarium, and digitized significant numbers of new biodiversity records, adding to the information available for the plants of the region. Results: In all, 190,953 records of species in 1965 genera and 331 families were captured by midâ€2018. These data records covered 16 West African countries, with most of the records (10,000â€“99,999) from CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, and Cameroon, and the fewest data records from Mauritania (<100 records). The West African Plants Initiative has increased available digital accessible knowledge records for West African plants by about 54%. Several of the project institutions have put initial project data online as part of their Global Biodiversity Information Facility data contributions. The average cost of data capture ranged from US$0.50âˆ’1.00 per herbarium sheet. Discussion: Data capture has been costâ€effective because it is much less expensive than de novo field collections, allows for development of information resources even for regions in which political situations make contemporary field sampling impossible, and provides a historical baseline against which to compare newer data as they become available. This new paradigm in specimen digitization has considerable promise to accelerate and improve the process of generating highâ€quality biodiversity information, and can be replicated and applied in many biodiversityâ€rich, informationâ€poor regions to remedy the present massive gaps in information availability.

The genus comprises 18 species, without any records in the Neotropical realm yet. Here we describe O. sudamericana sp. nov., distributed in Argentina and Paraguay. The new species appears to be most closely related to O. chayuensis Yang, Song and Zhu, 2003. The male also resembles O. charitonovi (Mikhailov, 1986). Orthobula sudamericana sp. nov. females differ from these species by the straight and parallel insemination ducts, and males by the centrally located, U-shaped sperm duct. Further, we summarize details on its natural history and habitat characteristics.	SPECIES_DISTRIBUTIONS|TAXONOMY	2022-04-11T12:48:24.787Z	0270334-200613084148143
A pipeline for assessing the quality of images and metadata from crowd-sourced databases.	J. Billotte	bioRxiv	02.05.2022	2022-05-01T00:00:00.000Z	true	false	DOI		UNITED_STATES		JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.29.490112	10.1101/2022.04.29.490112	03b731be-8f55-35a4-ac7e-8d396e07c132	Crowd-sourced biodiversity databases provide easy access to data and images for ecological education and research. One concern with using publicly sourced databases; however, is the quality of their images, taxonomic descriptions, and geographical metadata. To address this concern and allow researchers and educators to make informed decisions about using crowd-sourced data, I developed a suite of pipelines to evaluate taxonomic consistency, how well geo-tagging fits known distributions, and image quality of crowd-sourced biodiversity data of the order Araneae (spiders) from iNaturalist. This pipeline allows users to analyze multiple images from iNaturalist and their associated metadata; to determine the level of taxonomic identification (family, genera, species) for each occurrence; whether the taxonomy label for an image matches accepted nesting of families, genera, and species; and whether geo-tags match the distribution of the taxon described using occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Infrastructure Facility (GBIF) as a reference. Additionally, I assessed image quality with the MatLab algorithm, BRISQUE. I used entries from the order Araneae (spiders) as a case study. At the time of my analyses (July 2021), I found that iNaturalist contained at least one observation for 124 of the 129 families of Araneae, and 115 families had three or more unique observations, with relatively similar quality of metadata and image quality across families. Taxonomic consistency was similar for observations identified at the genus and species level, but lower in observations with only family level identification. Observations with species level identifications had higher precision for geo-tags compared to those identified to the family or genus level and the highest image quality according to the BRISQUE scores. Overall, the results suggest that iNaturalist can provide large metadata and images sets for research. Given the inevitability of some low-quality observations, this pipeline provides a valuable resource for researchers and educators to evaluate the quality of iNaturalist and other crowd-sourced data.

A tradeâ€off between latitude and elevation contributes to explain range segregation of broadly distributed caveâ€dwelling spiders	Stefano Mammola|Thomas Hesselberg|Enrico Lunghi	Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research	30.10.2020	2020-10-29T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	generic_DOIs_provided		CHINA|UNITED_KINGDOM|ITALY|FINLAND	Tetragnathidae|altitudinal gradient|biogeography|competitive exclusion|niche partitioning|species distribution modeling	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1111/jzs.12432	10.1111/jzs.12432	9c9283ca-af09-301b-b735-798225f9cc9c	A fundamental goal in spatial ecology is to understand how the distribution of species varies along latitudinal and elevational gradients. This stems from the understanding that latitude and elevation are primary drivers affecting temperature variations on Earth's surface, and, in turn, that temperature plays a critical ecological role. These spatial gradients have been primarily documented using highly dispersive surface speciesâ€”butterflies, birds, and plantsâ€”whereas studies on subterranean organisms remain scattered. The orbâ€web cave spiders Meta bourneti and M. menardi are ubiquitous inhabitants of European caves whose distributions stretches over a continental distance. They share a similar ecological niche, which should translate into competitive exclusion in coâ€occurring areas. Therefore, it can be predicted that there should be an effective spatial segregation between the two species along broadscale spatial gradients. Using a dataset of >3,000 georeferenced records, we show that the two species are primarily segregated along the latitudinal gradient, with M. menardi progressively becoming more frequent and M. bourneti rarer from south to north. In their overlapping range (36.5â€“53.4Â° latitude), the two species are secondarily separated along an elevational gradient, with M. menardi occupying, on average, sites at higher elevations than M. bourneti. However, in the northernmost part of its range and in the absence of its competitor, M. menardi inhabits caves at lower elevations. This clear pattern provides a textbook example of the tradeâ€off between latitude and elevation in determining habitat segregation of broadly distributed competing species.

Accounting for sampling patterns reverses the relative importance of trade and climate for the global sharing of exotic plants	Helen R. Sofaer|Catherine S. Jarnevich	Global Ecology and Biogeography		2017-03-01T00:00:00.000Z	false	true	DOI	UNITED_STATES	UNITED_STATES		JOURNAL	http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/geb.12577	1466822X|10.1111/geb.12577	9ea46fb0-3a87-35d5-80c7-28e92635ce87	Aim The distributions of exotic species reflect patterns of human-mediated dispersal, species climatic tolerances and a suite of other biotic and abiotic factors. The relative importance of each of these factors will shape how the spread of exotic species is affected by ongoing economic globalization and climate change. However, patterns of trade may be correlated with variation in scientific sampling effort globally, potentially confounding studies that do not account for sampling patterns. Location Global. Time period Museum records, generally from the 1800s up to 2015. Major taxa studied Plant species exotic to the United States. Methods We used data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to summarize the number of plant species with exotic occurrences in the United States that also occur in each other country world-wide. We assessed the relative importance of trade and climatic similarity for explaining variation in the number of shared species while evaluating several methods to account for variation in sampling effort among countries. Results Accounting for variation in sampling effort reversed the relative importance of trade and climate for explaining numbers of shared species. Trade was strongly correlated with numbers of shared U.S. exotic plants between the United States and other countries before, but not after, accounting for sampling variation among countries. Conversely, accounting for sampling effort strengthened the relationship between climatic similarity and species sharing. Using the number of records as a measure of sampling effort provided a straightforward approach for the analysis of occurrence data, whereas species richness estimators and rarefaction were less effective at removing sampling bias. Main conclusions Our work provides support for broad-scale climatic limitation on the distributions of exotic species, illustrates the need to account for variation in sampling effort in large biodiversity databases, and highlights the difficulty in inferring causal links between the economic drivers of invasion and global patterns of exotic species occurrence.

Addressing risks to biodiversity arising from a changing climate: The need for ecosystem restoration in the Tana River Basin, Kenya	Rhosanna L. M. Jenkins|Rachel F. Warren|Jeff T. Price	PLOS ONE	22.07.2021	2021-07-21T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI	KENYA	UNITED_KINGDOM		JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254879	10.1371/journal.pone.0254879	7d358329-2f45-3b05-91d8-5c195498bc03	Climate change is projected to have significant effects on the distribution of species globally, but research into the implications in parts of Africa has been limited. Using species distribution modelling, this study models climate change-related risks to the terrestrial biodiversity (birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and plants) of Kenyaâ€™s economically-important and ecologically diverse Tana River Basin. Large reductions in species richness are projected with just 2Â°C warming (relative to preindustrial levels) with birds and plants seeing the greatest impact. Potential climate refugia for biodiversity are identified within the basin, but often overlap with areas already converted to agriculture or set aside for agricultural expansion, and the majority are outside protected areas. Similarly, some protected areas contain no projected refugia at higher levels of global warming, showing they may be insufficient to protect the basinâ€™s biodiversity as climate changes. However, risks to biodiversity are much smaller if the Paris Agreementâ€™s goal of limiting global warming to â€˜well below 2Â°Câ€™ warming, rather than 2Â°C only, is met. The potential for refugia for plants and animals decreases strongly with warming. For example, 82% of the basin remaining climatically suitable for at least 75% of the plants currently present at 1.5Â°C warming, as compared with 23% at 2Â°C and 3% at 4.5Â°C. This research provides the first assessment of the combined effects of development plans and climate change on biodiversity of the Tana River Basin, including identifying potential areas for restoration, and contributes to a greater understanding of biodiversity protection and adaptation options in Kenya.

Alien flora of Turkey: checklist, taxonomic composition and ecological attributes	Ahmet Uludag|Necmi Aksoy|AyÅŸe YazlÄ±k|Zubeyde Filiz Arslan|Efecan YazmÄ±ÅŸ|Ilhan Uremis|Tiziana Antonella Cossu|Quentin Groom|Jan Pergl|Petr PyÅ¡ek|Giuseppe Brundu	NeoBiota	07.07.2017	2017-06-02T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI		BELGIUM|CZECH_REPUBLIC|UNITED_KINGDOM|ITALY|TURKEY		JOURNAL	http://neobiota.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=12460	1314-2488|10.3897/neobiota.35.12460	6bae501a-425c-37c8-bd2b-58aa47c8f812	The paper provides an updated checklist of the alien flora of Turkey with information on its structure. The alien flora of Turkey comprises 340 taxa, among which there are 321 angiosperms, 17 gymnosperms and two ferns. Of the total number of taxa, 228 (68%) are naturalized and 112 (32%) are casual. There are 275 neophytes (172 naturalized and 103 casual) and 61 archaeophytes (52 naturalized and 9 casual); four species could not be classified with respect to the residence time. In addition, 47 frequently planted taxa with a potential to escape are also listed. The richest families are Asteraceae (38 taxa), Poaceae (30), Fabaceae (23) and Solanaceae (22). As for the naturalized alien plants, the highest species richness is found in Asteraceae (31 taxa), Poaceae (22), Amaranthaceae (18) and Solanaceae (15). The majority of alien taxa are perennial (63.8% of the total number of taxa with this life history assigned, including those with multiple life histories), annuals contribute 33.8% and 2.4% are biennial aliens. Among perennials the most common life forms are phanerophytes, of which 20.3% are trees and 12.6% shrubs; woody vines, stem succulents, and aquatic plants are comparatively less represented. Most of the 340 alien taxa introduced to Turkey have their native ranges in Americas (44.7%) and Asia (27.6%). Of other regions, 9.1% originated in Africa, 4.4% in Eurasia, 3.8% in Australia and Oceania and 3.5% in the Mediterranean. The majority of taxa (71.9%) were introduced intentionally, whereas the remaining (28.1%) were introduced accidentally. Among the taxa introduced intentionally, the vast majority are ornamental plants (55.2%), 10.0% taxa were introduced for forestry and 6.7% as crops. Casual alien plants are most commonly found in urban and ruderal habitats (40.1%) where naturalized taxa are also often recorded (27.3%). Plants that occur as agricultural weeds are typically naturalized rather than casual (16.0% vs 7.1%, respectively). However, (semi)natural habitats in Turkey are often invaded by alien taxa, especially by those that are able to naturalize.	INVASIVES	2020-11-24T15:51:55.413Z	0045772-160910150852091
An assessment of liverwort richness, endemicity and conservation in a megadiverse country - Colombia	Yeison Jaroc Lombo-Sanchez|Karen Yuliana Suarez-Contento|MÃ©rcia PatrÃ­cia Pereira Silva|KÃ¡tia Cavalcanti PÃ´rto	Biodiversity and Conservation	04.09.2024	2024-09-04T00:00:00.000Z	false	true	generic_DOIs_provided	COLOMBIA	BRAZIL	Andes|Biogeographic regions|Bryophytes|Distribution patterns|Diversity|Neotropics	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-024-02926-6	10.1007/s10531-024-02926-6	4ecc6f79-c40b-3002-9484-d5c7fd42cdbc	Knowing the centers of richness and endemism is crucial for prioritizing biodiversity conservation efforts, particularly in taxa susceptible to environmental changes and in regions of significant biological importance. We used species occurrence data from species lists, online information sources, and herbarium records to identify the centers of endemism of liverworts in Colombia. Sampling biases were assessed using the â€˜sampbiasâ€™ package. Geospatial analyses were applied to identify species richness and endemism centers, with the latter identified using the NDM/VNDM algorithm. Species conservation status was evaluated based on IUCN Red List criterion B using the â€˜ConRâ€™ package. Despite low sampling efforts across all regions, the collection bias model revealed disparities in sampling, with fewer expected records in the Orinoco, Caribbean, and Amazon regions, highlighting the need for new inventories in these priority areas. The Andean (567 total species, 16 endemic species and subspecies) and Pacific (301 total species, 7 endemic species) regions stood out with higher richness. Two centers of endemism were identified: the Pacific and the Andean regions, emerging as priorities for conservation investments. Only 4% of the total area of the centers of endemism in Colombia was found within protected areas (PAs), and 40% of species were classified as threatened. Despite the challenges, 22.7% of the endemic species are found within PAs, underscoring the urgent need for efficient PA management, especially those located along the central Andes Mountain range.

The current practice of delimiting biomes relies on expert knowledge. Recent studies have questioned the value of such biome maps for comparative ecology and globalâ€change research, partly due to their subjective origin. Here we propose a flexible method for developing biome maps objectively. The method uses range modelling of several thousands of plant species to reveal spatial attractors for different growthâ€form assemblages that define biomes. The workflow is illustrated using distribution data from 23,500 African plant species. In an example application, we create a biome map for Africa and use the fitted species models to project biome shifts. In a second example, we map gradients of growthâ€form suitability that can be used to identify sites for comparative ecology. This method provides a flexible framework that allows a range of biome types to be defined according to user needs. The method also enables projections of biome changes that emerge purely from the individualistic responses of plant species to environmental changes.

Analysis of endemism of world arthropod distribution data supports biogeographic regions and many established subdivisions	Jonathan Liria|Claudia A. Szumik|Pablo A. Goloboff	Cladistics	20.12.2020	2020-12-19T00:00:00.000Z	false	true	DOI		ECUADOR|UNITED_STATES|VENEZUELA|ARGENTINA		JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1111/cla.12448	10.1111/cla.12448	f40ce997-2986-3daf-bf43-2792dca63d8d	We analyzed 769 242 occurrence records for 115 424 species of terrestrial arthropods, from three biodiversity repositories (Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), Natural History Museum, London, and â€œSistema de InformaÃ§Ã£o DistribuÃ­do para ColeÃ§Ãµes BiolÃ³gicasâ€ (SpeciesLink)), to test the use of globalâ€scale data points for quantitative assessments of areas of endemism. The data include Insecta (105,941 species), Arachnida (7984 species), Myriapoda (1229) and terrestrial crustaceans (270 Branchiopoda). The species were assigned to 14 543 higher taxonomic groups because such groups often characterize larger areas of endemism. Putative areas of endemism were visualized as sets of cells displaying unique groups of species without the assumption of hierarchical relationships. Yet, the use of 10Â° grid cells recovered many large areas broadly corresponding to biogeographic Regions (Nearctic, Neotropical, Panamanian, Palaearctic, Afrotropical, Australian, Oceanian and Oriental) albeit with the limits poorly defined. An analysis of 5Â° grids resulted in 306 sets included in the different biogeographic Realms: Afrotropical, Australian, Madagascan, Nearctic, Neotropical, Oceanian, Oriental, Palaearctic, Saharoâ€Arabian and Sinoâ€Japanese. The Panamanian Realm comprises 89 partly overlapping sets, crossing the Nearctic and Neotropical boundaries. A total of 7338 species of Insecta were endemic to some areas (Sinoâ€Japanese, Afrotropical, Panamanian, Palaearctic, among others), followed by Arachnida (412 spp) and 105 species in other clades ranked as â€œclassesâ€. Six sets were supported only by genera, except for Panamanian sets that were supported by genera and families. Many of the species in the dataset are included in IUCN red lists, but probably most of those have distributions more restricted than global areas of endemism; only 102 appear as endemic to some area (Neartic, Madagascan, Panamanian, Afrotropical, among others). The results show that data from global databases can be used to identify areas of endemism on a worldwide basis butâ€”owing to their incompletenessâ€”only at a relatively coarse level. At the level of resolution currently allowed by such databases, such global studies are only complementary to studies where areas are determined subjectively by systematists (instead of actual point records), or studies using point records in datasets for specific taxonomic groups curated and compiled by specialists.

Animal invaders threaten protected areas worldwide	Xuan Liu|Tim M.

However, alien species invasion is an increasing threat to biodiversity, and the extent to which protected areas worldwide are resistant to incursions of alien species remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate establishment by 894 terrestrial alien animals from 11 taxonomic groups including vertebrates and invertebrates across 199,957 protected areas at the global scale. We find that <10% of protected areas are home to any of the alien animals, but there is at least one established population within 10-100â€‰km of the boundaries of 89%-99% of protected areas, while >95% of protected areas are environmentally suitable for establishment. Higher alien richness is observed in IUCN category-II national parks supposedly with stricter protection, and in larger protected areas with higher human footprint and more recent designation.

Anthropogenic threats can have cascading homogenizing effects on the phylogenetic and functional diversity of tropical ecosystems	Daniel S. Park|Onja H.

This cannot be accomplished by examining a single taxonomic group, as communities comprise a plethora of interactions across species and trophic levels. Here, we examine the patterns and relationships among plant, mammal, and bird diversity in Madagascar, a hotspot of biodiversity and endemism, across taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional axes. We found that plant community diversity and structure are shaped by geography and climate, and have significant influences on the taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity of mammals and birds. Patterns of primate diversity, in particular, were strongly correlated with patterns of plant diversity. Furthermore, our findings suggest that plant and animal communities could become more phylogenetically and functionally clustered in the future, leading to homogenization of the flora and fauna. These results underscore the importance and need of multiâ€taxon approaches to conservation, given that even small threats to plant diversity can have significant cascading effects on mammalian and avian community diversity, structure, and function.

Applying XGBoost and SHAP to Open Source Data to Identify Key Drivers and Predict Likelihood of Wolf Pair Presence	Jeanine Schoonemann|Jurriaan Nagelkerke|Terri G.

Numbers have grown to 209 territorial pairs in 2021. XGBoost machine learning, combined with SHAP analysis is applied to predict German wolf pair presence in 2022 for 10â€‰Ã—â€‰10â€‰km grid cells. Model input consisted of 38 variables from open sources, covering the period 2000 to 2021. The XGBoost model predicted well, with 0.91 as the AUC. SHAP analysis ranked the variables: distance to the closest neighboring wolf pair was the main driver for a grid cell to become occupied by a wolf pair. The clustering tendency of related wolves seems to be an important explanatory factor here. Second was the percentage of wooded area. The next eight variables related to wolf presence in the preceding year, except at fifth, eighth and tenth position in the total order: human density (square root) in the grid, percentage arable land and road density respectively. Other variables including the occurrence of wild prey were the weakest predictors. The SHAP analysis also provided crucial added value in identifying a variable that had threshold values where its contribution to the prediction changed from positive to negative or vice versa. For instance, low density of people increased the probability of wolf pair presence, whereas a high density decreased this probability. Cumulative lift techniques showed that the model performed almost four times better than random prediction. The combination of XGBoost, SHAP and cumulative lift techniques is new in wolf management and conservation, allowing for the focusing of educational and financial resources.

Artificial Hotspot Occurrence Inventory ( AHOI )	Xiao Feng|Daniel S Park|Hanna T Thammavong|Rima Tulaiha|Yingying Xie	Journal of Biogeography	25.11.2022	2022-11-25T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI		UNITED_STATES	bias|biodiversity|centroid|coordinates|duplication|georeferencing|grid|imperfect data|uncertainty	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14543	10.1111/jbi.14543	37ca7ce4-a574-38ef-b239-e9a816644765	Aim Species occurrence records are essential to understanding Earth's biodiversity and addressing global environmental issues, but do not always reflect actual locations of occurrence. Certain geographical coordinates are assigned repeatedly to thousands of observation/collection records. This may result from imperfect data management and georeferencing practices, and can greatly bias the inferred distribution of biodiversity and associated environmental conditions. Nonetheless, these â€˜biodiverseâ€™ coordinates are often overlooked in taxon-centric studies, as they are identifiable only in aggregate across taxa and datasets, and it is difficult to determine their true circumstance without in-depth, focused investigation. Here we assess highly recurring coordinates in biodiversity data to determine artificial hotspots of occurrences.  Location Global.  Taxon Land plants, birds, mammals, insects.  Methods We identified highly recurring coordinates across plant, bird, insect and mammal records in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the largest aggregator of biodiversity data. We determined which are likely artificial hotspots by examining metadata from over 40 million records, assessing spatial distributions of associated datasets, contacting data managers and reviewing literature. These results were compiled into the Artificial Hotspot Occurrence Inventory (AHOI).  Results Artificial biodiversity hotspots generally comprised geopolitical and grid centroids. The associated uncertainty ranged from several square kilometres to millions. Such artificial biodiversity hotspots were most prevalent in plant records. For instance, over 100,000 plant occurrence records were assigned the centroid coordinates of Brazil, and points that have at least 1000 associated occurrences comprised over 9 million records. In contrast, highly recurring coordinates in animal data more often reflected actual sites of observation.  Main conclusions AHOI can be used to (i) improve accuracy of biodiversity assessments; (ii) estimate uncertainty associated with records from artificial hotspots and make informed decisions on whether to include them in scientific studies; and (iii) identify problems in biodiversity informatics workflows and priorities for improvement.

However, data scarce regions continue to be less well studied, limiting the comprehensiveness of the approach and its potential benefits. Here we aim to assess multiple ES and their spatial relationships in a region with high tropical forest cover, the state of AmapÃ¡, in the Brazilian Amazon. We develop a simple method to measure nine ES, identify spatial associations between them, and explore the impact of land use change on the capacity of forests to provide those services. The ES analysed include biodiversity, regional climate regulation, indigenous heritage, agricultural production, and NTFP extraction. Both negative (nâ€¯=â€¯20) and positive (nâ€¯=â€¯12) spatial associations are found, with agricultural land and forests having the highest total ES provision. We also show that this varies nonlinearly with distance to forest edges. In the face of currently unavoidable data scarcities in high biodiversity tropical areas, we show that this approach can provide useful evidence for land use management decisions.

Asynchronous multi-decadal time-scale series of biotic and abiotic responses to precipitation during the last 1300 years	Sangheon Yi|Chang-Pyo Jun|Kyoung-nam Jo|Hoil Lee|Min-Seok Kim|Sang Deuk Lee|Xianyong Cao|Jaesoo Lim	Scientific Reports	23.10.2020	2020-10-20T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	generic		CHINA|KOREA_SOUTH		JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74994-x	10.1038/s41598-020-74994-x	bcffd7cd-4fe8-3bf5-a196-ddd6fb04768d	East Asian summer monsoon (EASM)-driven rapid hydroclimatic variation is a crucial factor with major socioeconomic impacts. Nevertheless, decadal- to centennial-scale EASM variability over the last two millennia is still poorly understood. Pollen-based quantitative annual precipitation (PqPann) and annual precipitation reconstructed by artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the period 650â€“1940 CE were reconstructed from a paleo-reservoir in South Korea. ANNs reconstruction was performed to compensate for a hiatus section. On a decadal timescale, 10 high-precipitation periods were identified, and PqPann and ANNs reconstructions were comparable to local instrumental rainfall and historic drought records. Biotic lags to rapid climatic changes ranging from 25 to 100 years were recognized by asynchronous pollen and speleothem responses to precipitation. We suggest that PqPann-based decadal- to centennial-scale climatic change reconstruction should take biotic lags into account, although the lags can be ignored on the millennial scale. The position of the EASM rainband influenced rainfall magnitude.

Automating the construction of higher order data representations from heterogeneous biodiversity datasets	Nicky Nicolson		19.11.2019	2019-11-19T00:00:00.000Z	false	false	DOI		UNITED_KINGDOM	Biodiversity informatics|Clustering|Machine learning|Record linkage|Specimen digitisation	THESIS	http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/19620		b1eaf0a4-785e-3b10-9277-677089e70b86	Datasets created from large-scale specimen digitisation drive biodiversity research, but these are often heterogeneous: incomplete and fragmented. As aggregated data volumes increase, there have been calls to develop a â€œbiodiversity knowledge graphâ€ to better interconnect the data and support meta-analysis, particularly relating to the process of species description. This work maps data concepts and inter-relationships, and aims to develop automated approaches to detect the entities required to support these kinds of meta-analyses. An example is given using trends analysis on name publication events and their authors, which shows that despite implementation and widespread adoption of major changes to the process by which authors can publish new scientific names for plants, the data show no difference in the rates of publication. A novel data-mining process based on unsupervised learning is described, which detects specimen collectors and events preparatory to species description, allowing a larger set of data to be used in trends analysis. Record linkage techniques are applied to these two datasets to integrate data on authors and collectors to create a generalised agent entity, assessing specialisation and classifying working practices into separate categories. Recognising the role of agents (collectors, authors) in the processes (collection, publication) contributing to the recognition of new species, it is shown that features derived from data-mined aggregations can be used to build a classification model to predict which agent-initiated units of work are particularly valuable for species discovery. Finally, shared collector entities are used to integrate distributed specimen products of a single collection event across institutional boundaries, maximising impact of expert annotations. An inferred network of relationships between institutions based on specimen sharing relationships allows community analysis and the definition of optimal co-working relationships for efficient specimen digitisation and curation.

However these patterns are typically delineated at a coarser resolution than the key ecological processes shaping both land-use and biological distributions. The â€˜Biogeographic modelling Infrastructure for Large-scaled Biodiversity Indicatorsâ€™ (BILBI) integrates advances in macroecological modelling, informatics, remote sensing and high-performance computing to assess spatio-temporal change in collective properties of biodiversity, particularly beta diversity, at ~1 km grid resolution across the entire terrestrial surface of the planet. BILBI greatly refines the mapping of biodiversity patterns relative to more traditional surrogates such as ecoregions and species range maps. This capability is already proving of considerable value in informing global assessments through: 1) generation of indicators of past-to-present change in biodiversity resulting from habitat transformation or protection; and 2) projection of potential future change in biodiversity resulting from alternative global-change scenarios.

Nature-based tourism can theoretically contribute to local and sustainable development by creating attractive livelihoods that support biodiversity conservation, but whether tourists prefer to visit more biodiverse destinations is poorly understood. We examine this question in Costa Rica and find that more biodiverse places tend indeed to attract more tourists, especially where there is infrastructure that makes these places more accessible. Safeguarding terrestrial biodiversity is critical to preserving the substantial economic benefits that countries derive from tourism. Investments in both biodiversity conservation and infrastructure are needed to allow biodiverse countries to rely on tourism for their sustainable development.

However, some strategies to mitigate GHG emission involve greater land-based mitigation efforts, which may cause biodiversity loss from land-use changes. Here we estimate how climate and land-based mitigation efforts interact with global biodiversity by using an integrated assessment model framework to project potential habitat for five major taxonomic groups. We find that stringent GHG mitigation can generally bring a net benefit to global biodiversity even if land-based mitigation is adopted. This trend is strengthened in the latter half of this century. In contrast, some regions projected to experience much growth in land-based mitigation efforts (i.e., Europe and Oceania) are expected to suffer biodiversity loss. Our results support the enactment of stringent GHG mitigation policies in terms of biodiversity. To conserve local biodiversity, however, these policies must be carefully designed in conjunction with land-use regulations and societal transformation in order to minimize the conversion of natural habitats.

We report 281 species (228 invertebrates and 53 vertebrates), including 51 troglobionts (cave-obligate species), from more than 150 sites (caves, springs, and wells). Endemism is high; of the troglobionts, 17 (33 % of those known from the state) are endemic to Georgia and seven (14 %) are known from a single cave. We identified three biogeographic clusters of troglobionts. Two clusters are located in the northwestern part of the state, west of Lookout Mountain in Lookout Valley and east of Lookout Mountain in the Valley and Ridge. In addition, there is a group of troglobionts found only in the southwestern corner of the state and associated with the Upper Floridan Aquifer. At least two dozen potentially undescribed species have been collected from caves; clarifying the taxonomic status of these organisms would improve our understanding of cave biodiversity in the state. Conservation concerns related to species found in Georgia caves are significant, with fourteen species (including 13 vertebrates) considered â€œHigh Priority Speciesâ€ under the Georgia State Wildlife Action Plan, many of these species have additional state or federal protections. In addition, 17 invertebrate troglobionts (33 % of those known in the state) are considered â€œCritically Imperiledâ€ by NatureServe. Several biologically important caves are not protected, these are an important conservation concern. However, remarkably, around one third of all caves in the state are on protected lands, including seven of the eight caves known to host ten or more troglobionts.

Biodiversity losses associated with global warming of 1.5 to 4 Â°C above pre-industrial levels in six countries	J. Price|R. Warren|N.

We quantify in a spatially explicit fashion the species richness remaining or lost, allowing the identification of climate refugia which we define as areas where > 75% of the species currently present remain in a world with a particular level of global warming above pre-industrial levels. In all countries and in both taxa, species richness declines with warming, as does the proportion of each country remaining a climate refugium for plants or vertebrates. In percentage terms, refugia loss relative to a 1961â€“1990 baseline period is greatest in India and Brazil, and least in Ghana and Ethiopia for the same level of warming, and is greater for plants than for vertebrates. Taking account of present land uses (i.e. area still considered natural), and using species richness of plants as a proxy to indicate biodiversity more generally, the proportion of land acting as climate refugia for biodiversity in five of the countries variously declines from 32â€“75% of a country in the 1961â€“1990 baseline period to 20â€“64% for 1.5 Â°C global warming, 11â€“53% for 2 Â°C, 3â€“33% for 3 Â°C and 2â€“24% for 4 Â°C warming. In Ethiopia, India, Brazil and China, climate refugia decline rapidly with warming while in Ghana and China some refugia persist even with 3â€“4 Â°C of warming. Only small percentages of Brazil, India and China are both climate refugia and lie within protected areas; hence, an expansion of the protected area networks in these countries would be required to deliver climate resilient biodiversity conservation. These percentages are larger in Ethiopia and Ghana and, in some areas of Ghana, the only remaining refugia are in protected areas, the remaining landscape converted to other uses.

Biogeographical â€distributions of trickster animals	Shota Shibasaki|Ryosuke Nakadai|Yo Nakawake	Royal Society Open Science	10.05.2024	2024-05-07T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI		JAPAN|UNITED_KINGDOM|UNITED_STATES	biome|cultural evolution|ecological constraints|folklore|species distribution	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.231577	10.1098/rsos.231577	8113c839-84c4-32f1-afba-682fe785044c	Human language encompasses almost endless potential for meaning, and folklore can theoretically incorporate themes beyond time and space. However, actual distributions of the themes are not always universal and their constraints remain unclear. Here, we specifically focused on zoological folklore and aimed to reveal what restricts the distribution of trickster animals in folklore. We applied the biogeographical methodology to 16 taxonomic categories of trickster (455 data) and real (93â€‰090â€‰848â€‰data) animals obtained from large databases. Our analysis revealed that the distribution of trickster animals was restricted by their presence in the vicinity and, more importantly, the presence of their corresponding real animals. Given that the distributions of real animals are restricted by the annual mean temperature and annual precipitation, these climatic conditions indirectly affect the distribution of trickster animals. Our study, applying biogeographical methods to culture, paves the way to a deeper understanding of the interactions between ecology and culture.

Biological invasions on Indigenous peoplesâ€™ lands	Hanno Seebens|Aidin Niamir|Franz Essl|Stephen T. Garnett|Joy A. Kumagai|Zsolt MolnÃ¡r|Hanieh Saeedi|Laura A. Meyerson	Nature Sustainability	30.05.2024	2024-06-01T00:00:00.000Z	false	true	DOI		GERMANY|UNITED_STATES|HUNGARY|AUSTRIA|AUSTRALIA		JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-024-01361-3	10.1038/s41893-024-01361-3	a5d2867b-9589-3f56-8c7c-846d6f216c07	Biological invasions are a growing challenge in a highly interconnected and globalized world, leading to the loss of native biodiversity. Indigenous peoplesâ€™ lands (IPLs) play a vital role in biodiversity conservation through activities such as land stewardship and management practices. Similar to protected areas, they are also often remote, with fewer connections to international trade networks. The extent to which IPLs are threatened by the spread of invasive species is still unknown. Here we provide a global study detailing the distribution and drivers of alien species on IPL. On average, IPLs host 30% (in absolute numbers: 11â€‰Â±â€‰3.5) fewer alien species relative to other lands, after controlling for sampling intensities. Alien species numbers remained consistently lower on IPLs even after accounting for potentially confounding factors such as differences in accessibility and ecological integrity. The difference may result from land management practices of Indigenous peoples. In the relatively small number of cases where IPLs host disproportionately higher numbers of alien species than other lands, the most likely reason is high alien species propagule pressure arising from proximity to large urban areas. Overall, our results highlight the importance of IPLs in protecting nature in the face of increasing biological invasions. Indigenous peoplesâ€™ lands (IPLs) are important reservoirs of biodiversity; however, the extent to which these lands are affected by the growing number of biological invasions worldwide is still unknown. This study evaluates whether IPLs harbour fewer alien species compared with other lands globally.

bRacatus : a method to estimate the accuracy and biogeographical status of georeferenced biological data	Eduardo ArlÃ©|Alexander Zizka|Petr Keil|Marten Winter|Franz Essl|Tiffany Knight|Patrick Weigelt|Marina JimÃ©nezâ€MuÃ±oz|Carsten Meyer	Methods in Ecology and Evolution	15.05.2021	2021-05-14T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI		NETHERLANDS|GERMANY|AUSTRIA	GBIF|checklists|data quality|data uncertainty|invasion biology|range maps|vegetation plot data	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210x.13629	10.1111/2041-210x.13629	fd069bd5-b463-3a39-9cf1-3fab992428e0	Georeferenced biological data of species distributions, abundances or traits are critical for ecological and evolutionary research. However, the accuracy (true vs. false records) and biogeographical status (native vs. alien) of individual georeferenced records are often unclear, which limits their use in species distribution modelling, analyses of biodiversity change and other applications. Here, we introduced bRacatus, a new method and R package to estimate a given georeferenced record's probability of being true or false and of corresponding to a native or an alien occurrence. Our framework avoided artificial thresholds of data filtering and instead implemented a probabilistic framework which allowed propagating uncertainties in subsequent analyses. We trained and tested our method on 400 terrestrial species of amphibians, birds, terrestrial mammals and vascular plants from four continents. bRacatus showed good predictive power (mean AUC higher than 0.9; mean RMSE lower than 0.3) for both the accuracy and biogeographical status. Model performance was similar among continents, range sizes and taxa not used in the training. Tests were robust using either range maps or regional checklists of differing levels of data completeness as reference regions. bRacatus was implemented as a user-friendly R package that enabled researchers to assess the accuracy and biogeographical status of species occurrences, population abundances, community composition or any other type of georeferenced biodiversity records. We proposed this method as a routine step in addressing the inherent uncertainty of point observations to promote more accurate ecological inference and predictions.

Camera traps (CTs), combined with computer vision models, provide an efficient method to survey species of certain taxa with high spatio-temporal resolution. We test the potential of CTs to close biodiversity knowledge gaps by comparing CT records of terrestrial mammals and birds from the recently released Wildlife Insights platform to publicly available occurrences from many observation types in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. In locations with CTs, we found they sampled a greater number of days (mean = 133 versus 57 days) and documented additional species (mean increase of 1% of expected mammals). For species with CT data, we found CTs provided novel documentation of their ranges (93% of mammals and 48% of birds). Countries with the largest boost in data coverage were in the historically underrepresented southern hemisphere. Although embargoes increase data providers' willingness to share data, they cause a lag in data availability. Our work shows that the continued collection and mobilization of CT data, especially when combined with data sharing that supports attribution and privacy, has the potential to offer a critical lens into biodiversity.           This article is part of the theme issue â€˜Detecting and attributing the causes of biodiversity change: needs, gaps and solutionsâ€™.

Climate-driven changes in the composition of New World plant communities	K. J. Feeley|C. Bravo-Avila|B. Fadrique|T. M. Perez|D.

Specifically, rising temperatures should cause increasing relative abundances of heat-loving or heat-tolerant species (that is, â€˜thermophilizationâ€™) and changes in precipitation should cause altered abundances of water-demanding species. We analysed millions of records of thousands of species and found that the plant communities in most ecoregions in North, Central and South America have experienced thermophilization over the past four decades (1970â€“2011). Thermophilization was fastest in ecoregions with intermediate temperatures and was positively correlated with warming rates within many biomes. Changes in the relative abundances of water-demanding species were less consistent and were not correlated with changes in precipitation, meaning that the drought sensitivity of some ecoregions may be increasing despite decreasing rainfall and increasing probabilities of drought. Climate-driven changes in plant community composition will affect the function and stability of New World ecoregions.	CLIMATE_CHANGE	2020-11-24T15:53:14.286Z	0003822-180508205500799
Climatic and vegetational drivers of insect beta diversity at the continental scale	Douglas Chesters|Philip BeckschÃ¤fer|Michael C. Orr|Sarah J.

Location: Global; North and Central America; Western Europe. Time period: 21st century. Major taxa studied: Insects. Methods: An informatics system was developed to integrate terrestrial data on insects with environmental parameters. We mined repositories of data for distribution, climatic data were retrieved (WorldClim), and vegetation parameters inferred from remote sensing analysis (MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields). Beta diversity between sites was calculated and then modeled with two methods, Mantel test with multiple regression and generalized dissimilarity modeling. Results: Geographic distance was the main driver of insect beta diversity. Independent of geographic distance, bioclimate variables explained more variance in dissimilarity than vegetation variables, although the particular variables found to be significant were more consistent in the latter, particularly, tree cover. Tree cover gradients drove compositional dissimilarity at denser coverages, in both continental case studies. For climate, gradients in temperature parameters were significant in driving beta diversity more so than gradients in precipitation parameters. Main conclusions: Although environmental gradients drive insect beta diversity independently of geography, the relative contribution of different climatic and vegetational parameters is not expected to be consistent in different study systems. With further incorporation of additional temporal information and variables, this approach will enable the development of a predictive framework for conserving insect biodiversity at the global scale.

CLIMATIC NICHE DETERMINES THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF MYRTACEAE SPECIES IN BRAZILIAN SUBTROPICAL ATLANTIC FOREST	JÃ©ssica Thalheimer de Aguiar|Pedro Higuchi|Ana Carolina da Silva	Revista Ãrvore	10.03.2021	2021-03-05T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI	BRAZIL	BRAZIL	Biogeography|Multivariate ordination|Niche analysis	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-908820210000001	10.1590/1806-908820210000001	3b122eb4-2ed5-3a4d-b402-da7f2bbb0b5b	The understanding of factors determining species geographic distribution is a fundamental aim of ecology. We investigated the environmental niche for three Myrtaceae species in the Brazilian Subtropical Atlantic Forest (BSAF), part of a global conservation hotspot. Based on a literature review, we selected one representative Myrtaceae species in three important forest types in this region: Evergreen Rain Forest (coastal plains and associated mountains ranges); Araucaria Forest, and Seasonal Deciduous Forest (continental upland areas). Geographical coordinates of their distribution were obtained from the BIEN database. As explanatory variables, we considered altitude, climate, cloud cover, and soil classes. We summarized the environmental space occupied by each pair of species using Principal Components Analysis, determined niche overlaps, and applied statistical tests to verify niche equivalences and similarities. The selected species in Evergreen Rain Forest, Araucaria Forest, and Seasonal Deciduous Forest were Myrcia splendens (Sw.) DC., Myrcia guianensis (Aubl.) DC., and Campomanesia xanthocarpa O.Berg., respectively. C. xanthocarpa showed a more restricted geographic distribution than the two Myrcia species that occur from central America to southern Brazil. Speciesâ€™ geographic distribution were fundamentally determined by temperature and rainfall regimes. Only C. xanthocarpa and M. guianensis, from uplands forest formations, showed environmental niche equivalence. In conclusion, we found that both species of Myrcia showed high climatic niche amplitudes occurring throughout the climatic gradient, while C. xanthocarpa was more subtropical, distributed mostly in the south and southeast of Brazil.

We are losing species at a high rate, even before their extinction risk is assessed. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List is the most complete assessment of all species conservation status, yet it only covers a small part of the species identified so far. Additionally, many of the existing assessments are outdated, either due to the ever-evolving nature of taxonomy, or to the lack of reassessments. The assessment of the conservation status of a species is a long, mostly manual process that needs to be carefully done by experts. The conservation field would gain by having ways of automating this process, for instance, by prioritising the species where experts and financing should focus on. In this paper, we present a pipeline used to derive a conservation dataset out of openly available data and obtain predictions, through machine learning techniques, on which species are most likely to be threatened. We applied this pipeline to the different groups within the Reptilia class as a model of one of the most under-assessed taxonomic groups. Additionally, we compared the performance of models using datasets that include different sets of predictors describing species ecological requirements and geographical distributions such as IUCNâ€™s area and extent of occurrence. Our results show that most groups benefit from using ecological variables together with IUCN predictors. Random Forest appeared as the best method for most species groups, and feature selection was shown to improve results.	CONSERVATION	2022-04-12T08:33:49.271Z	0090957-200613084148143
Commiphora of the highlands and escarpments of Angola and Namibia	A Weeks|W Swanepoel	 Brian J Huntley	18.12.2023	2023-12-16T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI	ANGOLA|NAMIBIA	UNITED_STATES|SOUTH_AFRICA|NAMIBIA	Angola|Commiphora|Namibia|escarpments|evolution|highlands	JOURNAL	https://nje.org.na/index.php/nje/article/view/volume8-weeks		bc3f83f2-c05e-381c-adc6-78ff86577009	The myrrh genus, Commiphora Jacq. (Burseraceae), comprises approximately 190 species of trees and shrubs worldwide that are most commonly encountered in the seasonally dry and arid biomes of sub-Saharan Africa. The diversity of Commiphora species in southwestern Africa is notable for its many restricted-range species, including nine that were only discovered within the last two decades. Of the 36 species native to the region, the majority (29 species) are endemic or near- endemic to Angola and/or Namibia and 22 species occur at elevations of 1,000 masl or greater. Molecular phylogenetic data reveal that early divergences within the genus probably involved exchanges between southwestern Africa and Madagascar beginning in the Miocene, and that extant species in southwestern Africa arose from several different evolutionary lineages. Some species divergences within the largest radiation of southwest African endemic species appear to be associated with elevational disjunctions or latitudinal disjunctions between the Kaokoveld and Gariep centres of endemism, some of which are hypothesised to have occurred as recently as the Quaternary. Despite Commiphora being renowned for its fragrant oleoresins and ethnobotany, fundamental aspects of Commiphoraâ€™s systematic biology, ecology and evolution remain understudied. Many species have yet to be included in molecular phylogenetic analyses. Other major avenues for investigation include characterising speciesâ€™ anatomical and physiological abilities to withstand the extreme heat and the water deficit of their natural environment; their reproductive ecology; and the chemical ecological interactions mediated by the diverse secondary chemistry of their oleoresins. Future research priorities include exploratory fieldwork to document the species of Commiphora in Angola, collaborative efforts to improve biodiversity informatic resources for the genus and integrative approaches to expand our understanding of Commiphoraâ€™s ecology and evolution within a comprehensive phylogenomic framework.

Community Composition and Biogeography of Beetles and Spiders Across an Elevational Gradient in Denali National Park, Alaska	Adam Haberski		28.09.2020	2020-08-01T00:00:00.000Z	false	false	DOI		UNITED_STATES		THESIS	https://search.proquest.com/docview/2444891462		5007f919-7b99-3eb4-a542-ced5e67065a1	Anthropogenic climate change is rapidly altering alpine ecosystems in Alaska. Trees and woody shrubs are expanding upslope and displacing alpine tundra. As alpine tundra habitats shrink and fragment, arthropods and other animals face an increased risk of extirpation due to smaller population sizes and reduced geneflow. Arthropodsâ€”insects, spiders, and their relativesâ€”are the most speciose component of the alpine fauna and perform key ecosystem services, such as pollination and nutrient cycling, and are food for vertebrates. Many species have responded by shifting their distribution to higher elevations, but species respond to change idiosyncratically, which could alter species interactions and disrupt communities. I compared beetle and spider communities along an elevational gradient in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska, an area with a complex biogeographic history and a poorly known arthropod fauna, in order to 1) examine differences in diversity, abundance, and community composition among forest, shrub, and alpine tundra habitats; 2) link the observed differences to abiotic factors relevant to climate change; and 3) test if shared habitat preferences lead to community-level patterns in geographic distribution. After three consecutive summers of sampling, I found that alpine tundra supports an unexpectedly diverse arthropod community with a high proportion of unique species and that vegetation cover and mean air temperature are strongly correlated with community composition. I therefore expect species losses among alpine tundra communities as shrubification continues. Community-level distribution patterns were not observed, but trends in the data point to a reduction of Holarctic distributions among forest-dwelling arthropods and an increased proportion of Beringian endemics among tundra species. This was the first systematic survey of Denaliâ€™s terrestrial arthropods and added over 450 new park records.	BIOGEOGRAPHY	2020-11-24T15:50:07.686Z	0041670-200221144449610

In recognition of the tremendous value of useful plants and of the increasing threats to their persistence, international agreements including the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Sustainable Development Goals, and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture have created ambitious conservation targets which must be measured through quantitative indicators so as to facilitate the development and implementation of strategies aimed at safeguarding their genetic diversity. Gaps in the current list of functioning indicators for these targets suggest that the development of effective measurements of the state of conservation of the genetic diversity within useful plants is a major challenge. Here we present a gap analysis indicator methodology that provides a pragmatic estimate of the comprehensiveness of conservation of the genetic diversity within useful wild plants, both ex situ and in situ. The methodology compares the geographic and ecological variation evident from analyses of the â€˜site of collectionâ€™ of samples of plant taxa that are safeguarded in genebanks and other living plant repositories, as well as the variation evident in the proportion of speciesâ€™ ranges inhabiting protected areas, against the full range of geographic and ecological variation in their native distributions. The methodology enables a prioritization of species for immediate conservation action, and, when measured periodically, can quantify progress toward comprehensive conservation of these plants at global, regional, and national scales, including determining when that goal has been reached. Assessing almost 7000 taxa with the â€œComprehensiveness of conservation of useful wild plantsâ€ indicator, we find that they are currently highly under-conserved, with less than three out of every 100 taxa assessed as sufficiently conserved or of low priority for further conservation action (overall global indicator = 2.78). Indicator results at the national and regional scales as well as by species use type varied, although virtually all countries, regions, and use categories were found to require further conservation action, particularly with regard to ex situ conservation. The results as well as input data and method code are available for indicator reporting and for conservation prioritization setting.

Convolutional neural networks improve species distribution modelling by capturing the spatial structure of the environment	Benjamin Deneu|Maximilien Servajean|Pierre Bonnet|Christophe Botella|FranÃ§ois Munoz|Alexis Joly		19.03.2021	2020-12-12T00:00:00.000Z	false	false	DOI		FRANCE		WORKING_PAPER	https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francois-Munoz/publication/349882696		35fa88c7-20ce-38ba-9355-7491ef911017	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are statistical models suited for learning complex visual patterns. In the context of Species Distribution Models (SDM) and in line with predictions of landscape ecology and island biogeography, CNN could grasp how local landscape structure affects prediction of species occurrence in SDMs. The prediction can thus reflect the signatures of entangled ecological processes. Although previous machine-learning based SDMs can learn complex influences of environmental predictors, they cannot acknowledge the influence of environmental structure in local landscapes (hence denoted â€punctual modelsâ€). In this study, we applied CNNs to a large dataset of plant occurrences in France (GBIF), on a large taxonomical scale, to predict ranked relative probability of species (by joint learning) to any geographical position. We examined the way local environmental landscapes improve prediction by performing alternative CNN models deprived of information on landscape heterogeneity and structure (â€ablation experimentsâ€). We found that the landscape structure around location crucially contributed to improve predictive performance of CNN-SDMs. CNN models can classify the predicted distributions of many species, as other joint modelling approaches, but they further prove efficient in identifying the influence of local environmental landscapes. CNN can then represent signatures of spatially structured environmental drivers. The prediction gain is noticeable for rare species, which open promising perspectives for biodiversity monitoring and conservation strategies. Therefore, the approach is of both theoretical and practical interest. We discuss the way to test hypotheses on the patterns learnt by CNN, which should be essential for further interpretation of the ecological processes at play.

crestr An R package to perform probabilistic climate reconstructions using fossil proxies	Manuel Chevalier	Climate of the Past Discussions	06.12.2021	2021-12-02T00:00:00.000Z	true	false	DOI		GERMANY|SWITZERLAND		WORKING_PAPER	https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2021-153	10.5194/cp-2021-153	7340bb3a-0ed3-3999-8915-7169843c2171	Statistical climate reconstruction techniques are practical tools to study past climate variability from fossil proxy data. In particular, the methods based on probability density functions (PDFs) are powerful at producing robust results from various environments and proxies. However, accessing and curating the necessary calibration data, as well as the complexity of interpreting probabilistic results, often limit their use in palaeoclimatological studies. To address these problems, I present a new R package (crestr) to apply the CREST method (Climate REconstruction SofTware) on diverse palaeoecological datasets. crestr includes a globally curated calibration dataset for six common climate proxies (i.e. plants, beetles, chironomids, rodents, foraminifera, and dinoflagellate cysts) that enables its use in most terrestrial and marine regions. The package can also be used with private data collections instead of, or in combination with, the provided dataset. It also includes a suite of graphical diagnostic tools to represent the data at each step of the reconstruction process and provide insights into the effect of the different modelling assumptions and external factors that underlie a reconstruction. With this R package, the CREST method can now be used in a scriptable environment, thus simplifying its use and integration in existing workflows. It is hoped that crestr will contribute to producing the much-needed quantified records from the many regions where climate reconstructions are currently lacking, despite the existence of suitable fossil records.

crestr: an R package to perform probabilistic climate reconstructions from palaeoecological datasets	Manuel Chevalier	Climate of the Past	20.04.2022	2022-04-19T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI		GERMANY|SWITZERLAND		JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-821-2022	10.5194/cp-18-821-2022	14be9d5e-dea4-31d7-a3a7-b53bd0765a65	Statistical climate reconstruction techniques are fundamental tools to study past climate variability from fossil proxy data. In particular, the methods based on probability density functions (or PDFs) can be used in various environments and with different climate proxies because they rely on elementary calibration data (i.e. modern geolocalised presence data). However, the difficulty of accessing and curating these calibration data and the complexity of interpreting probabilistic results have often limited their use in palaeoclimatological studies. Here, I introduce a new R package (crestr) to apply the PDF-based method CREST (Climate REconstruction SofTware) on diverse palaeoecological datasets and address these problems. crestr includes a globally curated calibration dataset for six common climate proxies (i.e. plants, beetles, chironomids, rodents, foraminifera, and dinoflagellate cysts) associated with an extensive range of climate variables (20 terrestrial and 19 marine variables) that enables its use in most terrestrial and marine environments. Private data collections can also be used instead of, or in combination with, the provided calibration dataset. The package includes a suite of graphical diagnostic tools to represent the data at each step of the reconstruction process and provide insights into the effect of the different modelling assumptions and external factors that underlie a reconstruction. With this R package, the CREST method can now be used in a scriptable environment and thus be more easily integrated with existing workflows. It is hoped that crestr will be used to produce the much-needed quantified climate reconstructions from the many regions where they are currently lacking, despite the availability of suitable fossil records. To support this development, the use of the package is illustrated with a step-by-step replication of a 790â€‰000-year-long mean annual temperature reconstruction based on a pollen record from southeastern Africa.

Current GBIF occurrence data demonstrates both promise and limitations for potential red listing of spiders	Vaughn Shirey|Sini SeppÃ¤lÃ¤|Vasco Branco|Pedro Cardoso	Biodiversity Data Journal	24.12.2019	2019-12-19T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI		UNITED_STATES|FINLAND	Araneae|IUCN|arthropoda|conservation|extent of occurrence	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.3897/bdj.7.e47369	10.3897/bdj.7.e47369	a6b813cd-ae2f-3fd6-bba7-a839ffca46f0	Conservation assessments of hyperdiverse groups of organisms are often challenging and limited by the availability of occurrence data needed to calculate assessment metrics such as extent of occurrence (EOO). Spiders represent one such diverse group and have historically been assessed using primary literature with retrospective georeferencing. Here we demonstrate the differences in estimations of EOO and hypothetical IUCN Red List classifications for two extensive spider datasets comprising 479 species in total. The EOO were estimated and compared using literature-based assessments, Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)-based assessments and combined data assessments. We found that although few changes to hypothetical IUCN Red List classifications occurred with the addition of GBIF data, some species (3.3%) which could previously not be classified could now be assessed with the addition of GBIF data. In addition, the hypothetical classification changed for others (1.5%). On the other hand, GBIF data alone did not provide enough data for 88.7% of species. These results demonstrate the potential of GBIF data to serve as an additional source of information for conservation assessments, complementing literature data, but not particularly useful on its own as it stands right now for spiders.

These data include: species taxonomy, uses, and general geographic information (dataset 1); species occurrence data (dataset 2); global administrative areas data (dataset 3); eco-geographic predictors used in species distribution modeling (dataset 4); a world map raster file (dataset 5); species spatial distribution modeling outputs (dataset 6); ecoregion spatial data used in conservation analyses (dataset 7); protected area spatial data used in conservation analyses (dataset 8); and countries, sub-regions, and regions classifications data (dataset 9). These data are available at http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/2jxj4k32m2.1. In combination with the openly accessible methodology code (https://github.com/CIAT-DAPA/UsefulPlants-Indicator), these data facilitate indicator assessments and serve as a baseline against which future calculations of the indicator can be measured.

Data from public and governmental databases show that a large proportion of the regional animal species pool occur in cities in Germany	Fabio S T Sweet|Beate Apfelbeck|Maximilian Hanusch|Cynthia Garland Monteagudo|Wolfgang W Weisser	Journal of Urban Ecology	08.03.2022	2022-02-15T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI	GERMANY	GERMANY|AUSTRIA		JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1093/jue/juac002	10.1093/jue/juac002	dc4c64f7-d153-3aa2-85cb-43778621ae03	Cities have been shown to be biodiverse, but it is unclear what fraction of a regional species pool can live within city borders and how this differs between taxa. Among animals, most research has focused on a few well-studied taxa, such as birds or butterflies. For other species, progress is limited by the paucity of data. We used species occurrence data for 11 taxa and 23 German cities from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the different German states, in a 50-km buffer around the city centre, to investigate what proportion of species of the regional species pools also occur in cities. While data could be obtained for all cities from GBIF, state databases only provided data for a subset of cities. Sample coverage of data from GBIF was higher across all taxa than of the state databases. For each database and taxon, we analysed (i) all cities where the number of occurrences of a taxon was &amp;gt;50 and (ii) only those cities where additionally sample coverage was &amp;gt;0.85. Across all taxa studied on average, 44.9â€‰Â±â€‰7.2% (GBIF) and 40.8â€‰Â±â€‰9.6% (German states) of the species of the regional species pool were also found in cities. When all cities were considered together, more than 76% of all species occurred within city borders. Our results show that German cities harbour a large part of the regional diversity of different taxa when city borders rather than the city centre is considered. This opens up ample opportunities for conservation and for fostering humanâ€“nature relationships.

Deeply digging the interaction effect in multiple linear regressions using a fractional-power interaction term	Xinhai Li|Baidu Li|Guiming Wang|Xiangjiang Zhan|Marcel Holyoak	MethodsX	21.09.2020	2020-09-16T00:00:00.000Z	false	true	DOI		CHINA|UNITED_STATES|CANADA	Fractional-power interaction regression (FPIR)|InteractionFPIR|Multiple linear regression|Nonlinearity|R package	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2020.101067	10.1016/j.mex.2020.101067	be3f890d-d783-3996-93b6-7acbab35f5c0	In multiple regression Y ~ Î²0 + Î²1X1 + Î²2X2 + Î²3X1 X2 + É›., the interaction term is quantified as the product of X1 and X2. We developed fractional-power interaction regression (FPIR), using Î²X1M X2N as the interaction term. The rationale of FPIR is that the slopes of Y-X1 regression along the X2 gradient are modeled using the nonlinear function (Slope = Î²1 + Î²3MX1M-1 X2N), instead of the linear function (Slope = Î²1 + Î²3X2) that regular regressions normally implement. The ranges of M and N are from -56 to 56 with 550 candidate values, respectively. We applied FPIR using a well-studied dataset, nest sites of the crested ibis (Nipponia nippon).We further tested FPIR by other 4692 regression models. FPIRs have lower AIC values (-302 Â± 5003.5) than regular regressions (-168.4 Â± 4561.6), and the effect size of AIC values between FPIR and regular regression is 0.07 (95% CI: 0.04â€“0.10). We also compared FPIR with complex models such as polynomial regression, generalized additive model, and random forest. FPIR is flexible and interpretable, using a minimum number of degrees of freedom to maximize variance explained. We have provided a new R package, interactionFPIR, to estimate the values of M and N, and suggest using FPIR whenever the interaction term is likely to be significant.

The Data Quality Interest Group, established by Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) and GBIF, has been engaged in four main activities: developing a framework for the assessment and management of data quality using a fitness for use approach; defining a core set of standardised tests and associated assertions based on Darwin Core terms; gathering and classifying user stories to form contextual-themed use cases, such as species distribution modelling, agrobiodiversity, and invasive species; and developing a standardised format for building and managing controlled vocabularies of values. Using the developed framework, data quality profiles have been built from use cases to represent user needs. Quality assertions can then be used to filter data suitable for a purpose. The assertions can also be used to provide feedback to data providers and custodians to assist in improving data quality at the source. A case study, using two different implementations of tests and assertions based around the Darwin Core "Event Date" terms, were also tested against GBIF data, to demonstrate that the tests are implementation agnostic, can be run on large aggregated datasets, and can make biodiversity data more fit for typical research uses.

More than 2 million primary occurrence records from across India were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and eBird. These were processed into maps of inventory completeness across the country both prior to 1980 and after 2000, in an attempt to develop evaluations of faunal change resulting from global climate change. We found good coverage of the country by wellinventoried areas after 2000, but almost no coverage prior to 1980. As such, in before-and-after comparisons documenting effects of global change on Indian birds, the â€˜afterâ€™ is well documented, but the â€˜beforeâ€™ is lacking. This significant information gap points to the need for digital capture and open sharing of historical information regarding Indian bird speciesâ€™ occurrences; this information will derive in large part from natural history museum specimens, particularly in India and Great Britain, and potentially from older observational data sources and the literature.

Diminishing growth of zoological natural history collections threatens future research in the life sciences and beyond	D. C. Card	bioRxiv	03.10.2023	2023-10-02T00:00:00.000Z	true	false	DOI		UNITED_STATES		WORKING_PAPER	https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.29.560208	10.1101/2023.09.29.560208	05670185-554a-3210-8a80-0412659bdc1c	Natural history museums comprise a unique and important component of biological infrastructure worldwide, and underlie diverse research, education, and outreach in the natural sciences. Each museum is built around one or more biological collections that serve as a repository of important materials for study, which have contributed to scientific research in increasingly important areas ranging from understanding global climate change to developing new biotechnological applications. However, despite centuries of existence, global collections sizes have only been recently estimated, and aside from analyses of certain institutions or well-studied clades, little is known about how patterns of collecting activity across institutions, geographic regions, or taxonomic clades, or how these patterns vary across time. To address this important gap in our understanding of critical life sciences infrastructure, I gathered and analyzed zoological records associated with preserved specimens collected between 1900 and 2015 and housed in worldwide natural history collections using data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. My analysis indicated that global, museum-associated collecting activity focused on animals has varied greatly over time, peaking around 2000 and declining significantly since. By stratifying data by institution, nation, and taxonomic phylum and class, I also illuminated how individual data series contribute to these global patterns.  Institutions and nations had either concentrated or dispersed periods of relatively high collecting activity that occurred over different time periods, although most growth occurred in the second half of the 20th century for both many individual institutions and globally. Certain taxonomic clades comprise the largest proportions of collections records over this time period, namely arthropods (especially insects) and chordates (especially vertebrates), underscoring the taxonomically biased collecting histories of many institutions. Altogether, my analyses provide a critical, early view of historical zoological collecting activity and, to help other museum stakeholders to explore the data and results in more depth, I also describe and release NHMinformatics, an interactive dashboard built using R Shiny.

Ecological niche modelling and climate change in two species groups of huntsman spider genus Eusparassus in the Western Palearctic	Majid Moradmand|Masoud Yousefi	Scientific Reports	11.03.2022	2022-03-09T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI		GERMANY|IRAN		JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-08145-9	10.1038/s41598-022-08145-9	af28b3e2-8d85-3b1d-83c5-ba738e578870	The huntsman spidersâ€™ genus Eusparassus are apex arthropod predators in desert ecosystems of the Afrotropical and Palearctic ecoregions. The Eusparassus dufouri and E. walckenaeri clades are two distinct taxonomic, phylogenetic, and geographic units concerning morphology, molecular phylogeny, and spatial data; but little is known about their ecological niche. We applied the maximum-entropy approach and modelled ecologic niches of these two phylogenetically closely related clades. Ecological niches of the two clades were compared using identity and background tests and two different metrics, the Schoonerâ€™s D and Warrenâ€™s I. We also predicted the impacts of climate change on the distribution of the two clades. The results of the identity test showed that the ecological niches of the two clades were different in geographic space but were similar in environmental space. While results of the background test revealed that the ecological niches of the two clades were similar in geographic and environmental space. This indicated that â€œniche conservatismâ€ had an important role over the evolutionary time of allopatric diversification. However, the normalized difference vegetation index vs. topographic heterogeneity had influenced the niches of the dufouri and walckenaeri clades, respectively. The analyses recovered that the two cladesâ€™ climatically suitable habitats will increase under future climate (the year 2070). However, since the two clades are characterized by the narrow range of environmental optimum and the accordingly high limits of tolerance, they are vulnerable to climate change.

Effectively and accurately mapping global biodiversity patterns for different regions and taxa	Alice C. Hughes|Michael C.

Location: Global.  Time period Contemporary.  Major taxa studied Terrestrial vertebrates and Odonata.  Methods: We analysed the biases in 50,768 animal International Union for Conservation of Nature, Global Assessment of Reptile Distributions and BirdLife species maps and assessed the links between these maps and existing political boundaries and various nonâ€ecological boundaries to assess their accuracy for certain types of analyses. We crossâ€referenced each species map with data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to assess whether maps captured the whole range of a species and what percentage of occurrence points fell within the assessed range of the species. In addition, we used a number of different methods to map diversity patterns and compared these with highâ€resolution models of distribution patterns.  Results: On average, 20â€“30% of the nonâ€coastal range boundaries of species overlapped with administrative national boundaries. In total, 60% of areas with the highest spatial turnover in species (high densities of species range boundaries marking high levels of shift in the community of species present) occurred at political boundaries, which was especially common in Southeast Asia. Different biases existed for different taxa, with gridded analysis in reptiles, river basins in Odonata (except the Americas) and county boundaries for amphibians in the USA. On average, up to half (25â€“46%) of the recorded range points of species fell outside their mapped distributions. Filtered minimum convex polygons performed better than expert range maps in reproducing modelled diversity patterns.  Main conclusions Expert range maps showed high bias at administrative borders in all taxa, but this was highest at the transition from tropical to subtropical regions. The methods used were inconsistent across space, time and taxa, and the ranges mapped did not match species distribution data. Alternative approaches can reconstruct patterns of distribution better than expert maps, and dataâ€driven approaches are needed to provide reliable alternatives to gain a better understanding of species distributions.

Cyrtophora citricola is a species that was recently introduced to the American continent, however, it is unknown the way in which this species came to the continent nor the placed where the invasion came from. Until now, it has been considered that the species has a broad native distribution â€“ Europe, Africa and the East of Asia-, however, molecular analyses show considerable differences between the native populations, as well as they show that the South African populations are more similar to the populations in America. On the other hand, similarities in both morphology and behaviour between the Mediterranean and American populations, alongside the high commercial trade 9 between the two regions, support that this species might have arrived from the Mediterranean region. In order to elucidate the origin of the invasion of C. citricola, I used Ecological Niche Models, alongside Environmental Principal Component Analysis, to compare the environmental conditions of the two origin sited considered (South of Africa and the Mediterranean) to those of the sites where the species have been reported in the invaded region. As it is a recent invasion (just 20 years have passed since its first report), it is considered that the American populations will occur in sites with similar environmental conditions to those of the region where the species came from. Therefore, when comparing the environmental conditions associated to the American populations with those of the populations in both native regions, the native region with higher environmental similarity can be considered as the region of origin of the invasion. My results consistently support that the the South of Africa is the region with higher environmental similarity in comparison to the invaded sites in America. This agrees with the molecular analyses, and we conclude that it is highly possible the species migrated from the South of Africa. This results open the door to studies focused in assessing the possible impacts this species might have in the invaded sites, because knowing the natural history of the populations where the species came from allows us to assess the risks based on the aspects and interactions this species has in its own native habitat.

Enabling possibilities to quantify past climate from fossil assemblages at a global scale	Manuel Chevalier	Global and Planetary Change	03.02.2019	2019-01-30T00:00:00.000Z	false	true	DOI		SWITZERLAND	CREST method|GBIF database|Modern distributions|Palaeoclimate quantification|Probability density functions	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.01.016	10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.01.016	fda155ab-5197-3a27-977a-ebcf7a0c3589	The field of quantitative palaeoclimatology has made significant progress in the past decades. However, this progress has been spatially heterogeneous and strong discrepancies â€“ both in terms of quality and density â€“ exist between Europe and North America and the rest of the world. The need to balance this distribution of quantified records has never been stronger, and improving our understanding of past global climate is urgent in order to better evaluate and employ the predictions of climate models. In this paper, it is argued that this gap can be reduced by applying the climate reconstruction method CREST (Climate REconstruction SofTware) calibrated using the open-access GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) database, which contains hundreds of thousands modern distributions of numerous bio-indicator proxies (e.g. pollen, chironomids, foraminifers, etc.). Using the taxonomical diversity of the GBIF database, CREST can be used to reconstruct various climate and/or environmental parameters from assemblage variety of different records. Independent from the usual reconstruction techniques using surface samples for calibration, the CREST/GBIF framework can also be used as an independent tool that can be easily and efficiently applied (1) to complete the global coverage of climate reconstructions, as exemplified with a precipitation reconstruction from Lake Van, Turkey, (2) to revisit existing data sets to obtain new quantitative reconstructions, and (3) to evaluate and/or refine reconstructions based on other methods. The application of this tool promises to foster advances in our understanding of the past climate variability of the Earth system at a global scale.

However, specimen records currently available may be geographically or environmentally biased. Detailed knowledge of biases is useful for understanding and accounting for errors they introduce into analyses of biodiversity patterns. Here we study geographical and environmental biases in online records representing the flora of the Colombian Andes and explore their effect on sample completeness at different spatial scales. We found a strong geographical and environmental sampling bias. Plant records were concentrated close to cities where herbaria and researchers are located. The highlandsâ€…&amp;gt;â€…2000 m are better sampled, whereas mid- and lowlands remain poorly sampled (i.e. montane and lowland forest). Sampling completeness (SC) median across the Colombian Andes isâ€…&amp;lt;â€…75% at the scales studied. We explore possible causes of sampling bias, identify critical gaps and priority areas for plant sampling and make recommendations for strategies to increase SC and reduce biases.

Samples were obtained in three technical replicates at 1 km from the dam at 1, 13 and 25 m depths. For each minibarcodes -- COI, 12S and 16S -- 1.5 million paired-reads (150 base pairs) were sequenced. A total of 44 unique taxa were found. COI identified most of the taxa (34 taxa; 77.2 %) followed by 16S (14; 31.8 %) and 12S (10; 22.7 %). All minibarcodes identified fishes (13 taxa), however, COI detected other aquatic macro-invertebrates (18), algae (3) and amoebas (2). Richness was the same across the three depths (35 taxa), although, beta diversity suggested slightly divergent profiles. In just one location we identified 15 taxa never reported previously, 50% of the fish species identified in the last year of fishery monitoring and 13% of the species in biodiversity surveys performed from 2012 to 2021. Clustering into Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASV) showed that 12S and 16S are able to detect predominant haplotypes of fishes, suggesting they are suitable to study population genetics of this group. In this study we reviewed the species occurring within the Tr&amp;ecircs Irm&amp;atildeos reservoir according to previous conventional surveys and demonstrated that eDNA metabarcoding can be applied to monitor its biodiversity.

Global coordination is predicated on an understanding of the scope and capacity of existing monitoring programs, and the extent to which they use standardized, interoperable practices for data management. Global coordination also requires identification of gaps in spatial and ecosystem coverage, and how these gaps correspond to management priorities and information needs. We undertook such an assessment by conducting an audit and gap analysis from global databases and structured surveys of experts. Of 371 survey respondents, 203 active, long-term (&amp;gt;5 years) observing programs systematically sampled marine life. These programs spanned about 7% of the ocean surface area, mostly concentrated in coastal regions of the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. Seagrasses, mangroves, hard corals, and macroalgae were sampled in 6% of the entire global coastal zone. Two-thirds of all observing programs offered accessible data, but methods and conditions for access were highly variable. Our assessment indicates that the global observing system is largely uncoordinated which results in a failure to deliver critical information required for informed decision-making such as, status and trends, for the conservation and sustainability of marine ecosystems and provision of ecosystem services. Based on our study, we suggest four key steps that can increase the sustainability, connectivity and spatial coverage of biological Essential Ocean Variables in the global ocean: (1) sustaining existing observing programs and encouraging coordination among these; (2) continuing to strive for data strategies that follow FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable); (3) utilizing existing ocean observing platforms and enhancing support to expand observing along coasts of developing countries, in deep ocean basins, and near the poles; and (4) targeting capacity building efforts. Following these suggestions could help create a coordinated marine biodiversity observing system enabling ecological forecasting and better planning for a sustainable use of ocean resources.

Evaluation of moth community changes and northward shifts in response to climate warming in Korea using both local and global occurrences	Tae-Sung Kwon|Sung-Soo Kim|Elie Gaget|Won IL Choi|Dae-Seong Lee|Young-Seuk Park	Global Ecology and Conservation	11.12.2023	2024-01-31T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI	KOREA_SOUTH	KOREA_SOUTH|FRANCE	Climate change|Climate warming|Cold-adapted species|Community temperature index|Range shift|Warm-adapted species	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2023.e02763	10.1016/j.gecco.2023.e02763	4d4a322c-55b3-3ffc-acc4-80a383531c31	Although climate warming arguably induces changes in species distribution, thereby causing poleward shifts in various taxa, comprehensive research on the response of moths to climate warming is lacking. This study compared the distribution of macro-moths between historical (1978â€“2002) and recent (2011â€“2016) periods in South Korea using the macro-moth data collected at 18 survey sites to elucidate the changes in community composition. We used the community temperature index (CTI) to quantify the effect of temperature change on moth community changes. The CTI represents the average value of the species temperature index (STI; mid-value of thermal range) calculated using our local observations and global occurrences reported in the online database of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Our analysis revealed no significant difference in species richness between historical and recent surveys. However, some taxa, such as Uraniidae, Nolidae, Sphingidae, and Lasiocampidae, exhibited high turnover rates, while the number of sphingid moths with large body sizes greatly decreased. The temperature changes at the survey sites became pronounced with an increase in the survey interval (year) between historical and recent surveys (temperature increase = 0.0465Â â„ƒ /year), while the CTI change exhibited a weak signal for northward shift of moth species. The CTI using the local data indicated 0.09Â km/year of northward shift of moths, which is considerably slower than the northward shift (9.6Â km/year) of the isothermal bands. However, the CTI using global occurrence data, expected to improve the estimation of species thermal niches, did not show any sign of northward shift. When observed, the northward shifts of moths were primarily identified in the cold-adapted species with low STI values, suggesting that cold-adapted species are more sensitive and vulnerable to climate warming than warm-adapted species. These results indicate that the current distribution changes of species were uneven, and the species adapted to cold regions are the ones primarily responding to the temperature increase by migrating northward and to high elevations.

These gaps could be addressed by utilizing predictive models, but this requires ensuring that available information is environmentally representative. In this study we utilize data from GBIF to investigate geographical biases, gaps and spatial completeness patterns concerning species distribution for the main classes of terrestrial organism in Europe. By identifying the spatial units with comprehensive inventories for each class, we offer insights into their quantity, distribution, and ability to capture the environmental variability of the European subcontinent. The results clearly demonstrate a high spatial heterogeneity and variability between taxa in the number of well-surveyed spatial units, showing that the units with high completeness for vertebrates and vascular plants are several times more numerous than those available for invertebrates and mosses. Regarding the environmental variability represented by the available data, results demonstrate the uncoordinated and contingent character of the accumulation process of biodiversity information and the need of an extra effort, which should be more intense in those taxa with a lower geographical coverage of their data. These challenges raise doubts about the reliability of these data in providing a comprehensive understanding of biodiversity distribution, as well as hindering model estimations. Extra compilation efforts should be mainly directed towards those spatial units capable of improving the current environmental representation of the spatial units considered well-surveyed, to reach a representative sample capable of producing effective interpolations and reliable predictions of species distributions.

I produced genome size measurements for 151 new species, including 108 tarantulas (Theraphosidae), 20 scorpions (Scorpiones), 17 whip-spiders (Amblypygi), 1 vinegaroon (Thelyphonida), and 5 non-arachnid relatives â€“ centipedes (Chilopoda). I also developed a new methodology for non-lethal sampling of arachnid species that is inexpensive and portable, which will hopefully improve access to live specimens in zoological or hobbyist collections. I found that arachnid genome size is positively correlated with longevity, body size and growth rate. Despite this general trend, genome size was found to negatively correlate with longevity and growth rate in tarantulas (Theraphosidae). Tarantula (Theraphosidae) genome size was correlated negatively with latitude.

Extinction of threatened vertebrates will lead to idiosyncratic changes in functional diversity across the world	Aurele Toussaint|SÃ©bastien Brosse|C.

Here we measure the functional diversity of terrestrial and freshwater vertebrates in the six terrestrial biogeographic realms and predict their future changes through scenarios mimicking a gradient of extinction risk of threatened species. We show vastly different effects of extinctions on functional diversity between taxonomic groups and realms, ranging from almost no decline to deep functional losses. The Indo-Malay and Palearctic realms are particularly inclined to experience a drastic loss of functional diversity reaching 29 and 31%, respectively. Birds, mammals, and reptiles regionally display a consistent functional diversity loss, while the projected losses of amphibians and freshwater fishes differ across realms. More efficient global conservation policies should consider marked regional losses of functional diversity across the world.

Considered regionally in the context of Quaternary climate change, climate stability is generally accepted as being one of the major factors promoting the abundance of species now present in the CFR. However, little direct evidence is available from the region, and responses to changes in global boundary conditions have been difficult to assess. In this paper, we present new high-resolution stable isotope data from Pakhuis Pass, in the species-rich western CFR, and contextualise our findings through comparison with other records from the region. Combined, they indicate clear, coherent changes in regional hydroclimate, which we relate to broader forcing mechanisms. However, while these climate change events share similar timings (indicating shared macro-scale drivers), the responses are distinct between sites, in some cases expressing opposing trends over very short spatial gradients (<50 km). We describe the evolution of these trends, and propose that while long-term (105 yr) general climatic stability may have fostered high diversity in the region through low extinction rates, the strong, abrupt changes in hydroclimate gradients observed in our records may have driven a form of allopatric speciation pump, promoting the diversification of plant lineages through the periodic isolation and recombination of plant populations.

Factors affecting the availability of data on East African wildlife: the monitoring needs of conservationists are not being met	InÃ¨s Moreno|JÃ©rÃ´me Marcel Walter Gippet|Luca Fumagalli|P.J. Stephenson		26.10.2022	2022-10-26T00:00:00.000Z	false	false	DOI		SWITZERLAND	East Africa|Global Biodiversity Information Facility|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|Living Planet Index|biodiversity monitoring|data availability	WORKING_PAPER	https://www.speciesmonitoring.org/uploads/8/4/9/7/84975128/moreno_et_al_in_press_biodiversity___conservation.pdf		5ea0da84-f71a-3113-af38-b448c2b487ce	Understanding the status and abundance of species is essential for effective conservation decisionmaking. However, the availability of species data varies across space, taxonomic groups and data types. A case study was therefore conducted in a high biodiversity region â€“ East Africa â€“ to evaluate data biases, the factors influencing data availability, and the consequences for conservation. In each of the eleven target countries, priority animal species were identified as threatened species that are either protected by national governments, international conventions or conservation NGOs. We assessed data gaps and biases in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and the Living Planet Index. A survey of practitioners and decision makers was conducted to confirm and assess consequences of these biases on biodiversity conservation efforts. Our results showed data on species occurrence and population trends were available for a significantly higher proportion of vertebrates than invertebrates. We observed a geographical bias, with higher tourism income countries having more priority species and more species with data than lower tourism income countries. Conservationists surveyed felt that, of the 40 types of data investigated, those data that are most important to conservation projects are the most difficult to access. The main challenges to data accessibility are excessive expense, technological challenges, and a lack of resources to process and analyse data. With this information, practitioners and decision makers can prioritise how and where to fill gaps to improve data availability and use, and ensure biodiversity monitoring is improved and conservation impacts enhanced.

Fast prototype and rapid construction of three-dimensional and multi-scaled pitcher for controlled drainage by systematic biomimicry	Zhichao Dong|Tao Shen|Shijie Liu|Cunlong Yu|Chengqi Zhang|Ning Li|Ruochen Fang|Lei Jiang|Xingfei Li|Kang Yang	International Journal of Extreme Manufacturing	26.02.2024	2024-02-23T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI		CHINA	Micro-CT|biomimetic materials|digital twin|drainage|systematic biomimicry	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1088/2631-7990/ad2cde	10.1088/2631-7990/ad2cde	cd683ab7-cf37-3af0-90c3-d824bd9f01b0	Biomimetic materials that use natural wisdom to solve practical problems are developing rapidly. In-situ characterization of natural creatures with high spatial resolutions and rapid reconstruction of their digital twin model with the same sophisticated features as prototypes are the trend for systematic biomimicry. However, it faces bottlenecks and limits in fast characterization and fabrication, precise parameter optimization, geometric deviations control, and quality prediction. To solve these challenges, here, we demonstrate a state-of-the-art method taking advantage of Micro-CT and 3D printing for the fast characterization of the pitcher plant Nepenthes x ventrata and fabrication of its biomimetic model to obtain a superior drainage controller with multiscale structures with precise surface morphology optimization and geometric deviation control. The film-rupture-based drainage dynamic and mechanisms are characterized by X-ray and high-speed videography, which determines the crucial structures for unique directional drainage. Then the optimized artificial pitchers are further developed into sustained drainage devices with novel applications, such as detection, reaction, and smoke control.

Besides understanding the impact in the species, it has been advocated that answering if different traits will be differently impacted could allow refined predictions of how climate change will jeopardize biodiversity. Our aim was to evaluate if climate change will potentially impact plant species differently, considering their traits. We evaluated 608 plant species that occur in the naturally open areas of ferruginous outcrops (namely, cangas) in the National Forest of CarajÃ¡s (Eastern Amazon). Firstly, we estimated the effects of climate change on each species using species distribution modeling, and analyzed this impact in the set containing all species. Secondly, we classified plant species considering the following traits: (i) pollination syndromes (melittophily, phalaenophily, psychophily, cantharophily, entomophily, ornithophily, chiropterophily, anemophily); (ii) habit (tree, shrub, herb, liana, parasite); and (iii) the main habitat of occurrence (open areas and forests). Thirdly, we investigated if the effects of climate change could be significantly more intense considering all the different traits quoted. Our results showed that most plant species will potentially face reduction of suitable habitats under future climate and the scenarios showed that 42% of them may not find suitable areas in the cangas of CarajÃ¡s. We found no significant difference within each analyzed trait, considering the potential impact of climate change. The most climatically suitable areas (i.e., areas with high probability of species occurrence in the future) are those in the southwest of the study area. These areas can be considered as priority areas for species protection against climate change.	CLIMATE_CHANGE	2021-09-28T11:32:20.031Z	0021704-191105090559680
Gaps in DNA sequence libraries for Macaronesian marine macroinvertebrates imply decades till completion and robust monitoring	Pedro E. Vieira|Ana S. Lavrador|Manuela I. Parente|Paola Parretti|Ana C.

However, the depth and accuracy of the taxonomic identifications are mainly dependent on reference libraries containing representative and reliable sequences for the targeted species. In this study, we evaluated the gaps in the availability of DNA sequences and their accuracy for macroinvertebrates inhabiting Macaronesia's shallow marine habitats.  Location: Macaronesia (Azores, Madeira, Selvagens, Canaries).  Methods: Checklists of marine invertebrates occurring above 50 m depth were compiled using public databases and published checklists. The availability of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 18S rRNA (18S) gene sequences was verified in BOLD and GenBank. Finally, COI data were audited to check the congruence between morphospecies and Barcode Index Numbers (BINs).  Results: The taxonomic coverage of different phyla was greater for COI but unbalanced and variable among archipelagos. NIS were better represented in genetic databases (up to 73% and 59%, for COI and 18S, respectively) than native species (up to 47% and 31%, for COI and 18S, respectively). NIS displayed a higher number of discordant records, and native species, a higher quantity of cases of multiple BINs. Notably, DNA sequences generated from specimens collected from Macaronesia were found in less than 10% of the species. Projection of the rates of accretion of DNA sequences suggests that decades will be needed to complete these reference libraries.  Main conclusions The level of completion of reference libraries for Macaronesia's marine macroinvertebrates is generally poor. Without a solid effort to speed up the production of sequence data (i.e. generate more DNA barcodes), the ability to employ DNA-based biomonitoring of such vulnerable fauna is compromised. The high levels of suspected hidden diversity further deepen the expected gaps and reinforce the vulnerability of this endemism-rich fauna.

Here, we propose novel indicators of biodiversity data coverage and sampling effectiveness and analyze national trajectories in closing spatiotemporal knowledge gaps for terrestrial vertebrates (1950 to 2019). Despite a rapid rise in data coverage, particularly in the last 2 decades, strong geographic and taxonomic biases persist. For some taxa and regions, a tremendous growth in records failed to directly translate into newfound knowledge due to a sharp decline in sampling effectiveness. However, we found that a nationâ€™s coverage was stronger for species for which it holds greater stewardship. As countries under the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework renew their commitments to an improved, rigorous biodiversity knowledge base, our findings highlight opportunities for international collaboration to close critical information gaps.

Recent reports of wild bee decline and its potential consequences are thus worrisome. However, evidence is mostly based on local or regional studies; global status of bee decline has not been assessed yet. To fill this gap, we analyzed publicly available worldwide occurrence records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility spanning more than a century of specimen collection. We found a steep decreasing trend in the number of collected bee species occurring since the 1990's, which today is half from that found in the 1950's. These trends are alarming and encourage swift action to avoid further decline of these key pollinators.	ECOSYSTEM_SERVICES	2020-11-24T15:53:28.783Z	0001373-190621201848488|0012833-190320150433242

These so-called nitrogen fixing plants are widely used for reclamation of disturbed vegetation and improvement of soil fertility in agroforestry. Yet, available information about plants that are capable of establishing nodulation is fragmented and somewhat outdated. This article introduces the NodDB database of nitrogen fixing plants based on morphological and phylogenetic evidence (available at http://dx.doi.org/10.15156/BIO/587469) and discusses plant groups with conflicting reports and interpretation such as certain legume clades and the Zygophyllaceae family. During angiosperm evolution, nitrogen fixing plants became common in the fabid rather than in the â€˜nitrogen fixingâ€™ clade. The global GBIF plant species distribution data indicated that nitrogen fixing plants tend to be relatively more diverse in savanna and semidesert biomes. The compiled and re-interpreted information about nitrogen fixing plants enables accurate analyses of biogeography and community ecology of biological nitrogen fixation.

Global gradients in the distribution of animal polyploids	Kyle T. David	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences	24.11.2022	2022-11-21T00:00:00.000Z	false	true	DOI		UNITED_STATES		JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2214070119	10.1073/pnas.2214070119	62aacd60-064a-3ee1-a548-a0c2be00169f	             Whole genome duplications (WGDs) are one of the most dramatic mutations that can be found in nature. The effects of WGD vary dramatically but can have profound impacts on an organismâ€™s expression, cytotype, and phenotype, altering their evolutionary trajectory as a result. Despite the growing appreciation for the contribution of WGDs in animal evolution, the significant factors influencing how polyploid animal lineages are established and maintained are still not well understood. Many hypotheses have been proposed which predict how climate and environment may influence polyploid incidence and evolution. To test and distinguish between these hypotheses, I assembled a global dataset of polyploid occurrences in three animal clades (Amphibia, Actinopterygii, and Insecta). The dataset encompasses chromosomal, phylogenetic, environmental, and climatic data across 57,905 species in 2,223 terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecoregions. My analysis reveals a strong latitudinal gradient in all three clades, with the tendency for polyploid taxa to occur more frequently at higher latitudes. Many variables were significant (phylogenetic ANOVA             P             &lt; 0.05 after Bonferroni correction) between polyploids and diploids across taxa, notably those pertaining to temperature dynamics and glaciation. Glaciation in particular appears to be the most significant driver of polyploidy in animals, as these models had the highest relative likelihoods consistently across clades. These results contribute to a model of evolution wherein the broader genomic toolkit of polyploids facilitates adaptation and ecological resilience, enabling polyploids to colonize new or rapidly changing environments.

The effects of fires on bird diversity can be both positive, as they can create new habitats, and negative, as they can reduce nesting success. To fully understand the ecological implications of wildfires, we need to understand the spatial distribution of wildland bird diversity and fire regimes and how fire regimes affect wildland bird diversity ecosystems. Using data collected at a global scale, we examined effects of time-averaged fire regimes on the spatial diversity of wildland bird species. Initially, we used the MaxEnt algorithm to model the potential distribution of 1,115 wildland bird species over a 20-year period. We also processed satellite observations of burned areas (FIRECCI51) during the same period to estimate fire regime characteristics, including the average proportion of burnt vegetation, interannual variability in the burnt area, and fire intensity. Finally, the association between wild bird diversity and fire variables in each biome was determined through Spearman, Bonferroni, and Kruskal-Wallis statistics. Results Our findings revealed that (I) the most affected wildland bird communities are those found in tropical ecosystems, where the majority of fires occur; (II) high fire intensity values and a substantial proportion of burned vegetation have a positive impact on maintaining a diverse population of wildland birds in biomes characterized by savannah or grassland covers, as seen in temperate or tropical zones. Conversely, low fire intensity values and a smaller proportion of burned vegetation also promote greater diversity of wildland birds in boreal or temperate zones, and (III) in Mediterranean ecosystems, a clear association between wildland bird diversity and wildfires could not be established. Conclusions This research could help identify areas that are ecologically vulnerable to wildfires. It could also be useful in guiding regional studies aligned with developing sustainable landscape management practices and conserving priority ecological zones in tropical ecosystems. Antecedentes El fuego es una perturbaciÃ³n natural que impacta significativamente en los ecosistemas y juega un rol crucial en la distribuciÃ³n y preservaciÃ³n de la biota en todo el mundo. Los efectos de los incendios en la diversidad de aves pueden ser tanto positivos, dado que crean nuevos hÃ¡bitats, como negativos, dado que pueden reducir el Ã©xito deÂ nidificaciÃ³n. Para entender completamente las implicaciones ecolÃ³gicasÂ del fuego, necesitamos entender la distribuciÃ³n espacial de la diversidad de avesÂ silvestres en los diversos ecosistemas, asÃ­ como de los regÃ­menes de fuego, y cÃ³mo estos regÃ­menes de fuego impactan enÂ la diversidad de aves silvestres. A travÃ©s de diferentes bases de datos a escala global, examinamos los efectos espaciales de los diferentes regÃ­menes de fuego sobreÂ la distribuciÃ³n espacial de laÂ diversidad de aves silvestres. Inicialmente usamos el algoritmo MaxEnt para modelar la distribuciÃ³n potencial de 1.115 especies de aves silvestres durante un perÃ­odo de 20 aÃ±os. Procesamos asimismo observaciones satelitales de Ã¡reas quemadas (FIRECCI51) durante el mismo perÃ­odo para estimar las caracterÃ­sticas de los regÃ­menes de fuegos, incluyendo la proporciÃ³n de la vegetaciÃ³n quemada, la variabilidad interanual en el Ã¡rea quemada y la intensidad delfuego. Finalmente, la asociaciÃ³n entre la diversidad de las especies de aves silvestres y las variables del fuego para cada bioma fue determinada mediante losÂ estadÃ­sticos de Spearman, Bonferroni y Kruskal -Wallis. Resultados Nuestros resultados revelaron (I) las comunidades de aves silvestres mÃ¡s afectadas fueron aquellas encontradas en ecosistemas tropicales, donde ocurren la mayorÃ­a de los incendios; (II) Una alta intensidad de los fuegos y una proporciÃ³n sustancial de la vegetaciÃ³n quemada tiene un impacto positivo en el mantenimiento de lapoblaciÃ³n de aves silvestres en biomas caracterizados por cobertura de sabanas y pastizales, como se ven en zonas subtropicales o templadas. Por otro lado, una baja intensidad de los fuegos y una menor proporciÃ³n de vegetaciÃ³n quemada promueve una mayor diversidad de aves silvestres en zonas boreales o templadas, y (III) en ecosistemas mediterrÃ¡neos, no pudo establecerse una clara asociaciÃ³n entre la diversidad de aves y el fuego. Conclusiones Esta investigaciÃ³n puede ayudar a identificar Ã¡reas que son ecolÃ³gicamente vulnerables a incendios. Puede tambiÃ©n ser Ãºtil en guiar estudios regionales alineados con el desarrollo de prÃ¡cticas de manejo sostenible de paisajes y deÂ conservaciÃ³n deÂ zonas prioritarias a nivelÂ ecolÃ³gicoen ecosistemas tropicales.

Indeed, such information is vital for achieving Target 6 of the Kunmingâ€“Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. However, to-date indicators for tracking the environmental impacts of IAS have been either lacking or insufficient. Capitalizing on advances in data availability and impact assessment protocols, we developed environmental impact indicators to track realized and potential impacts of IAS. We also developed an information status indicator to assess the adequacy of the data underlying the impact indicators. We used data on 75 naturalized amphibians from 82 countries to demonstrate the indicators at a global scale. The information status indicator shows variation in the reliability of the data and highlights areas where absence of impact should be interpreted with caution. Impact indicators show that growth in potential impacts are dominated by predatory species, while potential impacts from bothÂ predation and disease transmission are distributed worldwide. Using open access data, the indicators are reproducible and adaptable across scales and taxa and can be used to assess global trends andÂ distributions of IAS, assisting authorities in prioritizing control efforts and identifying areas at risk of future invasions.           This article is part of the theme issue â€˜Ecological novelty and planetary stewardship: biodiversity dynamics in a transforming biosphereâ€™.

Here we explore the largeâ€scale distribution of Nâ€fixing plant species worldwide.  Location: Global.  Time period Present.  Major taxa studied Vascular plants.  Methods: We estimated rootâ€symbiotic Nâ€fixing plant species diversity (as Shannon entropy) and relative richness (logâ€ratio of Nâ€fixing to nonâ€fixing plant species) for c. 7,800 km2 hexagonal grid cells using the NodDB and Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) databases. Additionally, we explored the distributions of plant species associated with rhizobia, actinobacteria or cyanobacteria (relative to other plant species), and the relative richness of Nâ€fixing trees (logâ€ratio of Nâ€fixing to nonâ€fixing trees). We related Nâ€fixing plant species distribution to environmental (climate, soil) and biogeographical (biome, realm) variables using multiple linear regression.  Results: Nâ€fixing plant diversity and relative richness showed unimodal relationships with latitude. Diversity of Nâ€fixing plants was highest in warm and wet climates, but in dry biomes and in Australasia. The relative richness of Nâ€fixing plants was highest in warm and dry climates, in tropical and temperate grasslands and in Eurasia. Plants associated with cyanobacteria were more widely distributed near the equator, while those associated with rhizobia were more prevalent at the edge of the tropics, and those associated with actinobacteria at higher latitudes (especially in boreal forests). The relative richness of Nâ€fixing tree species was highest in cold and dry areas and in boreal forests, with contrasting peaks in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  Main conclusions The distribution of Nâ€fixing plant species exhibits regional hotspots and coldspots related to both environmental conditions and biogeographical history. Global Nâ€fixing plant distributions are different for the key rootâ€symbiotic bacterial groups. Information about Nâ€fixing plant distribution can improve global models of ecosystem functions and contribute to understanding how plants respond to global change.

High and dry: integrative taxonomy of the Andean spider genus Nerudia (Araneae: Pholcidae)	Bernhard A Huber|Guanliang Meng|JiÅ™Ã­ KrÃ¡l|IvalÃº M Ãvila Herrera|Matias A Izquierdo|Leonardo S Carvalho	Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society	15.03.2023	2023-03-13T00:00:00.000Z	false	true	DOI		BRAZIL|CZECH_REPUBLIC|GERMANY|ARGENTINA	Argentina|Gertschiola|NOR|barcodes|biogeography|distribution modelling|highest record|new species|sampling bias|sex chromosomes	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlac100	10.1093/zoolinnean/zlac100	3bc660b8-2942-3c11-92d0-b2b37d3b4bf1	Ninetinae are a group of poorly known spiders that do not fit the image of â€˜daddy long-legs spidersâ€™ (Pholcidae), the family to which they belong. They are mostly short-legged, tiny and live in arid environments. The previously monotypic Andean genus Nerudia exemplifies our poor knowledge of Ninetinae: only seven adult specimens from two localities in Chile and Argentina have been reported in the literature. We found representatives of Nerudia at 24 of 52 localities visited in 2019, mostly under rocks in arid habitats, up to 4450 m a.s.l., the highest known record for Pholcidae. With now more than 400 adult specimens, we revise the genus, describing ten new species based on morphology (including SEM) and COI barcodes. We present the first karyotype data for Nerudia and for its putative sister-genus Gertschiola. These two southern South American genera share a X1X2X3Y sex chromosome system. We model the distribution of Nerudia, showing that the genus is expected to occur in the Atacama biogeographic province (no record so far) and that its environmental niche is phylogenetically conserved. This is the first comprehensive revision of any Ninetinae genus. It suggests that focused collecting may uncover a considerable diversity of these enigmatic spiders.

Historic residential segregation impacts biodiversity data availability disparately across the tree of life	Dexter Locke|Melissa Chapman|Diego Ellis-Soto	EcoEvoRxiv	26.04.2024	2024-04-22T00:00:00.000Z	true	false	DOI	UNITED_STATES	UNITED_STATES	Global Biodiversity Information Facility|Home Ownersâ€™ Loan Corporation|biodiversity sampling|environmental justice|residential segregation	WORKING_PAPER	https://doi.org/10.32942/x2d04v	10.32942/x2d04v	274bd113-92b0-3b05-bc88-f24f15dd3e5f	Urbanization alters species ranges and natureâ€™s contributions to people, motivating urban conservation. Residential segregation policies have left an indelible impact on urban environments, greenspaces, and wildlife communities, creating socioeconomic heterogeneity and altering biota. However, the extent to which data sufficiently capture urban biodiversity patterns remains unclear, especially when considering historic segregation. We explore how biodiversity metrics (sampling density, estimated completeness of sampling, and expected species richness) vary by Home Ownerâ€™s Loan Corporation (HOLC) grade across taxonomic groups, leveraging nearly 60 million amphibia, aves, fungi, insecta, mammalia, plantae, and reptilia observations collected between 2000 and 2020, for 145 Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States. After accounting for environmental conditions, we estimate significant differences in sampling density across HOLC grade for all taxonomic groups, with the lowest values found in areas previously redlined. Estimated completeness of biodiversity inventory was low (average ~42% across all taxa) and varied significantly by HOLC grade for birds, mammals, and plants. Expected richness only varied by HOLC grade for birds. Our findings highlight how differences in biodiversity sampling may not translate to differences in expected species richness patterns, and suggest that applying insights obtained from certain taxonomic groups and extrapolating to multiple others may not be appropriate. Urban wildlife communities are not well-documented despite the explosion of digital information, and what is documented is known to be biased along a housing segregation typology for some taxon. These findings add evidence to suggest long-lasting effects of legacies of segregation on the natural world.	BIODIVERSITY_SCIENCE	2024-05-28T08:43:13.941Z	0234992-220831081235567
Historical plant introductions predict current insect invasions	Aymeric Bonnamour|Rachael E. Blake|Andrew M. Liebhold|Helen F. Nahrung|Alain Roques|Rebecca M. Turner|Takehiko Yamanaka|Cleo Bertelsmeier	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences	19.07.2023	2023-06-05T00:00:00.000Z	false	true	DOI		CZECH_REPUBLIC|JAPAN|SWITZERLAND|NEW_ZEALAND|FRANCE|AUSTRALIA		JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2221826120	10.1073/pnas.2221826120	86b99a04-e642-38a8-9eb2-685f028a270c	Thousands of insect species have been introduced outside of their native ranges, and some of them strongly impact ecosystems and human societies. Because a large fraction of insects feed on or are associated with plants, nonnative plants provide habitat and resources for invading insects, thereby facilitating their establishment. Furthermore, plant imports represent one of the main pathways for accidental nonnative insect introductions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that plant invasions precede and promote insect invasions. We found that geographical variation in current nonnative insect flows was best explained by nonnative plant flows dating back to 1900 rather than by more recent plant flows. Interestingly, nonnative plant flows were a better predictor of insect invasions than potentially confounding socioeconomic variables. Based on the observed time lag between plant and insect invasions, we estimated that the global insect invasion debt consists of 3,442 region-level introductions, representing a potential increase of 35% of insect invasions. This debt was most important in the Afrotropics, the Neotropics, and Indomalaya, where we expect a 10 to 20-fold increase in discoveries of new nonnative insect species. Overall, our results highlight the strong link between plant and insect invasions and show that limiting the spread of nonnative plants might be key to preventing future invasions of both plants and insects.

How well do species distribution models predict occurrences in exotic ranges?	Dat Nguyen|Brian Leung|Franziska Schrodt	Global Ecology and Biogeography	12.03.2022	2022-03-10T00:00:00.000Z	false	true	DOI		CANADA	GBIF|global|invasive species|presence-only data|species distribution model|transferability	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13482	10.1111/geb.13482	a042d612-e440-3cc8-84d2-d38ede99de45	Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used predictive tools to forecast potential biological invasions. However, the reliability of SDMs extrapolated to exotic ranges remains understudied, with most analyses restricted to few species and equivocal results. We examine the spatial transferability of SDMs for 647 non-indigenous species extrapolated across 1,867 invaded ranges, and identify what factors may help differentiate predictive success from failure.  Location Global.  Time period Current.  Major taxa studied Six hundred and forty-seven terrestrial species; eight taxonomic classes.  Methods We performed a large-scale assessment of the transferability of SDMs using two modelling approaches: generalized additive models (GAMs) and MaxEnt. We fitted SDMs on the native ranges of species and extrapolated them to exotic ranges. We examined the influence of general factors and factors related to biological invasions on spatial transferability.  Results Despite both modelling approaches performing well in the range of the species used for fitting, we observed moderate to low spatial transferability on average [mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) c. .7] when extrapolating to their invaded ranges. Transferability differed between taxonomic classes and invaded continents and was positively influenced by the performance of the model and environmental generalism in the native range, and the year of first record. Models performed worse with greater environmental coverage in the exotic range, gross domestic product and number of occurrences in the native range, geographic distance between ranges and when extrapolating to islands.  Main conclusions After controlling for sampling bias, half of SDMs were only weakly predictive, which should affect how SDM-based forecasts are interpreted. Performance differed based on characteristics of the data, species, and ranges, and can suggest when SDMs may be reliable and when we should be most cautious. These considerations touch directly upon the potential use of SDMs for management of biological invasions. We discuss possible mechanisms of these findings.

ï»¿DASCO: A workflow to downscale alien species checklists using occurrence records and to re-allocate species distributions across realms	Hanno Seebens|Ekin Kaplan	NeoBiota	21.06.2022	2022-06-17T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI		GERMANY|TURKEY|AUSTRIA	GBIF|biological invasion|checklists|coordinates|distribution|downscaling|marine ecoregions|neobiota|open science|workflow	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.74.81082	10.3897/neobiota.74.81082	aaf6f952-bd9a-3eca-8c81-1e64aaa1afda	ï»¿AbstractInformation about occurrences of alien species is often provided in so-called checklists, which represents lists of reported alien species in a region. In many cases, available checklists cover whole countries, which is too coarse for many analyses and limits capabilities of assessing status and trends of biological invasions. Information about point-wise occurrences is available in large quantities at online facilities such as GBIF and OBIS, which, however, do not provide information about the invasion status of individual populations. To close this gap, we here provide a semi-automated workflow called DASCO to downscale regional checklists using occurrence records obtained from GBIF and OBIS. Within the workflow, coordinate-based occurrence records for species listed in the provided regional checklists are obtained from GBIF and OBIS, and the status of being an alien population is assigned using the information in the provided checklists. In this way, information in checklists is made available at the local scale, which can then be re-allocated to any other spatial categorisation as provided by the user. In addition, habitats of species are determined to distinguish between marine, brackish, terrestrial, and freshwater species, which allows splitting the provided checklists to the respective realms and ecoregions. By using checklists of global databases, we showcase the usage of the DASCO workflow and revealed > 35 million occurrence records of alien populations in terrestrial and marine regions worldwide, which were back-transformed to terrestrial and marine regions for comparison. DASCO has the potential to be used as a basis for the widely applied species distribution models or assessments of status and trends of biological invasions at large geographic scales. The workflow is implemented in R and in full compliance with the FAIR data principles of open science.

Identification of sentinel plant species for evaluating phytotoxicity of veterinary antibiotics in Mediterranean Europe	Rosa M.

In the European Union, the potential effects of such antibiotics on terrestrial plants must be evaluated following the standardised OECD 208 method, which specifies the crop and wild species that should serve as â€œsentinelsâ€ for assessing antibiotic exposure. The present study aimed to compare this approved list of sentinel species against crop and wild plant species actually present in agricultural and pasture lands in Mediterranean Europe in order to identify the most appropriate sentinel plants for the region. The study focused on Spain as a region representative of Mediterranean Europe. Georeferenced layers for wild plant species and cultivated areas (crops), livestock density and land cover were combined, and then selection criteria were applied, leading to the identification of sentinel crop and wildÂ species for crop land and pasture scenarios. Results In the crop land scenario, the sentinel crop species were barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.), wheat ( Triticum spp.), corn (Zea mays L), sunflower ( Helianthus annuus L.), dried pea ( Pisum sativum L.), alfalfa ( Medicago sativa L.), vetch ( Vicia sativa L.), oilseed rape ( Brassica napus L.) and sugar beet ( Saccharum officinarum L.), all of them listed in the OECD 208 method with the exception of alfalfa; the sentinel wild species were Papaver rhoeas Â L., Galium aparine L.Â and Chenopodium album Â L. In the pasture scenario, sentinel wild species were Bromus tectorum Â L., Agrostis capillarisÂ  L., Trifolium pratense Â L., Lotus corniculatus L.Â and Galium aparineÂ  L. The following common weed species in field boundaries or in pasture lands also emerged as potential sentinel species for risk assessment, even though they are not listed in the OECD 208 method: Sonchus oleraceus Â L., Avena sterilis Â L., Dactylis glomerata Â L., Hordeum murinum L.Â and Lolium rigidum Gaudin. Conclusions The sentinel species identified in this study may be useful in risk assessment procedures covering the Mediterranean Europe. The method developed for this study could be applied to identify sentinel species for other representative agroclimatic regionsÂ in Europe (such asÂ Atlantic and Continental).

Recent studies have reported the impact of climate change on plant biodiversity. Thus, understanding the distribution pattern of the endemic legume species of the GC region under current and future climate scenarios are imperative for long-term conservation management plans. We used 762 occurrence data of the 237 endemic legume species to elucidate the habitat suitability and impact of climate change on the species. Analyses used an ecological niche modeling ensemble method to map the current and future (2050â€“2070) distribution patterns of the endemic legumes under the RCP 4.5 scenario. Further, we generated the ensemble of four different species distribution modeling methods to predict areas where climatically suitable regions is lost or gained under future climate change. The model predicted the current suitable areas for endemic legumes to be Southern Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of Congo (COG), and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Our findings indicate precipitation of Warmest Quarter and seasonality as the significant climatic variables affecting the habitat suitability of endemic legumes in the GC regions. Results showed areas such as the coastal region of Cote d' Ivoire, southwest province of Cameroon, Central African Republic, COG (Ngounnie), central DRC, and southern Nigeria will experience >40% loss of climatically suitable areas by 2050. Also, species such as Baphia maxima, and Psophocarpus scandens were projected to experience a 70% reduction in their climatically suitable areas under future climate scenarios. Our study concludes that the projected distribution of the endemic legume species in the GC region will consequently decline in the future due to the gross effect of climate change. The anticipated changes in the distribution patterns of the endemic legumes could have significant ecological and socioâ€economic significance. Therefore, we recommend improved conservation to protect the endemic legume species and its associated habitats in GC forest.	CLIMATE_CHANGE|ECOLOGY	2021-01-22T15:41:17.895Z	0009366-190918142434337
Insect and plant invasions follow two waves of globalisation	Aymeric Bonnamour|JÃ©rÃ´me M. W.

It is commonly thought that biological invasions have accelerated continuously over the last centuries, following increasing global trade. However, the world experienced two distinct waves of globalisation (~1820â€“1914, 1960-present), and it remains unclear whether these two waves have influenced invasion dynamics of many species. To test this, we built a statistical model that accounted for temporal variations in sampling effort. We found that insect and plant invasion rates did not continuously increase over the past centuries but greatly fluctuated following the two globalisation waves. Our findings challenge the idea of a continuous acceleration of alien species introductions and highlight the association between temporal variations in trade openness and biological invasion dynamics. More generally, this emphasises the urgency of better understanding the subtleties of socio-economic drivers to improve predictions of future invasions.

Integrating climateâ€change refugia into 30 by 30 conservation planning in North America	Brooke L Bateman|Nicole Forstenhaeusler|Erin Graham|Joanna Grand|Mariah Meek|Jeff Price|Sarah P Saunders|Rachel Warren|Chad B Wilsey	Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment	12.01.2023	2023-01-11T00:00:00.000Z	false	true	DOI		UNITED_KINGDOM|UNITED_STATES|AUSTRALIA		JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.2592	10.1002/fee.2592	35d3e4d7-bfd0-3ffb-9f47-a815ddc7672c	Countries have set targets for conserving natural areas to mitigate biodiversity loss, such as the protection of 30% of lands by 2030, commonly referred to as â€œ30 by 30â€. Yet strategic conservation planning to align those targets with climateâ€change refugia is lacking. We investigated the feasibility of achieving 30 by 30 in North America by assessing the proportions of state/provincial/territorial land projected to provide refugia for terrestrial biodiversity and the proportions of those refugia that are currently protected. We also conducted a reserve selection prioritization to identify priority areas that complement the current protected area network and capture refugia for seven taxonomic groups. In North America, <15% of refugia are protected, but ample opportunity exists to expand protection if warming is limited to 2Â°C. Beyond 2Â°C, however, the majority of refugia will occur only at high latitudes and elevations. Incorporation of refugia into 30 by 30 efforts will facilitate species persistence under climate change.	CONSERVATION|CLIMATE_CHANGE	2023-01-12T10:15:57.212Z	0000129-150523225239109

The perspective focuses on the ex-situ mass multiplication and in-situ conservation of the species through reintroduction under the species recovery initiative. The integration of effective conservation strategies viz macro and micro and intervention of modern technological tools for in-situ restoration of species were invoked. The macro propagation was carried out through seed germination and vertically segregating the profusely branched tuft of plants into small tufts along with the rhizome. The species was micro propagated through axillary bud explants in MS medium fortified with 4.4 ÂµM BAP and 0.53 ÂµM NAA was found to be the optimum for shoot induction having 98.23% of shoot formation with 11.32 mean shoot number per culture and shoot length of 4.6 cm. Shoots rooted in half strength MS medium supplemented with IBA (4.9 ÂµM) and 0.3% activated charcoal. Profuse rooting with average 24.58 roots per shoot was reported after 3-weeks of incubation. The plants were acclimatized in the glass house and were finally transferred to the open environment with 83% survival percentage. Under the species reintroduction and recovery programs, the propagated saplings were introduced into three different wild habitats located in Chakrata and Mussoorriee forest divisions of Uttarakhand and 44% survival was reported after six months of field transfer. The research demonstrates the successful coherence of ex-situ propagation methods with in-situ conservation through reintroduction initiatives. The efforts might be helpful in in-situ preservation of the germplasm and simultaneously to cater the escalating medicinal requirements of Gentiana kurroo.

Inventory incompleteness and collecting priority on the plant diversity in tropical East Africa	Shengwei Wang|Yadong Zhou|Paul Mutuku Musili|Geoffrey Mwachala|Guangwan Hu|Qingfeng Wang	Biological Conservation	12.11.2019	2019-11-06T00:00:00.000Z	false	true	generic_DOIs_provided		CHINA|KENYA	Biodiversity database|Collecting bias|Collecting-priority|Explanatory variables|Inventory incompleteness|Tropical East Africa flora	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2019.108313	10.1016/j.biocon.2019.108313	7da221c9-ec87-3513-a823-30b26c0c7cc5	Inventory incompleteness has seriously affected the accuracy of the spatial distribution pattern of biodiversity, but the causes of incompleteness and the priority investigation with quantitative methods have received far less attention. In this study, we constructed a plant database of tropical East Africa, evaluated and explained the inventory incompleteness, and identified the priority collecting area. The results showed that the spatial distribution pattern of collection density and species richness is very uneven in tropical East Africa, with 16 % of regions having zero-collection, and more than half of the regions having inventory incompleteness. Species collection and completeness are mainly affected by species richness and road density, followed by national boundaries and insecurity in some areas. We quantitatively selected priority investigation areas in tropical East Africa to supplement biodiversity data in the area. We recommend prioritizing collections especially around western Kenya, southern Tanzania, and around the border of Tanzania and Kenya. Future work should focus on improving the digitization of specimens and the strengthening of cooperation among countries, for these are the best ways to raise awareness of the biodiversity patterns in tropical East Africa.

Thus, the mobilization of natural history specimens data should be a priority task, which could be addressed by mean of digitization. Digital specimen are for a wealth of different uses, ranging from taxonomy to benefit sharing, andâ€”if data are properly standardizedâ€”are highly interoperable. However, of the ca.Â 1.5â€“3 billion specimens estimated otherwise exist, ca.Â 233 million only are available in the digital domain, since digitization is an highly demanding effort, in terms of time, personnel, and fundings. On the other hand, digitization is also a rewarding effort, especially when data are mobilized and made interoperable in major global repositories, as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. This contribution aims at depicting the role and effect of digitization of natural history collections, and the result of digitization efforts in Europe and in Italy in the last three decades.

Effective conservation management requires more thorough biodiversity surveys that can reveal system-level patterns and that can be applied rapidly across space and time. Using modern ecological models and community science, we integrate environmental DNA and Earth observations to produce a time snapshot of regional biodiversity patterns and provide multi-scalar community-level characterization. We collected 278 samples in Spring 2017 from coastal, shrub and lowland forest sites in California, a complex ecosystem and biodiversity hotspot. We recovered 16,118 taxonomic entries from eDNA analyses and compiled associated traditional observations and environmental data to assess how well they predicted alpha, beta, and zeta diversity. We found that local habitat classification was diagnostic of community composition and distinct communities and organisms in different kingdoms are predicted by different environmental variables. Nonetheless, gradient forest models of 915 families recovered by eDNA analysis and using Bioclim variables, Sentinel-2 satellite data, human impact, and topographical features as predictors, explained 35% of the variance in community turnover. Elevation, sand percentage, and photosynthetic activities (NDVI32) were the top predictors. In addition to this signal of environmental filtering, we found a positive relationship between environmentally predicted families and their numbers of biotic interactions, suggesting environmental change could have a disproportionate effect on community networks. Together, these analyses show that coupling eDNA with environmental predictors including remote sensing data, has capacity to test proposed Essential Biodiversity Variables and create new landscape biodiversity baselines that span the tree of life.

Large biodiversity datasets conform to Benford's law: Implications for assessing sampling heterogeneity	Judit K. Szabo|Lucas Rodriguez Forti|Corey T.

Understanding this sampling bias is fundamental to inform biodiversity conservation actions. However, currently available tests to assess data quality, such as fitting species abundance distribution (SAD) models and rarefaction curves are computationally costly and can still lead to erroneous conclusions.We evaluated Benford's law (first digit distribution) as a complementary method to assess data heterogeneity and survey coverage in large biodiversity datasets, including eBird data for 157 countries and three non-avian GBIF datasets. We also tested conformity to Benford's law of four simulated communities with different SAD models and four corrupted datasets with log-normal SAD. Finally, we evaluated the effect of including rare species in three datasets on the conformity to Benford's law and also compared Benford fit to the results of traditional methods to estimate survey completeness in seven datasets.Species-rich datasets with a large number of observations tended to obtain a good fit. Benford conformity can be a simple and sensitive measure of sampling evenness, complementing traditional methods to assess quality data in large-scale studies. Benford's test can reflect species abundance heterogeneity, especially in log-normally distributed data, but was not ideal to evaluate surveys completeness, as its results diverged from those of traditional methods.As the contribution of citizen science continues to increase in biodiversity monitoring, this fast and efficient method can play a critical role to assess the quality of datasets.

Recent efforts on gathering global data have not been sufficient to surpass biases and gaps. This incompleteness has serious consequences on conservation and ecological understanding, therefore it is of major importance to map, quantify and describe these flaws. In this paper we aimed to assess inventory incompleteness for the Atlantic Rainforest, concerning amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles. We also investigate if some environmental variables are correlated to biodiversity knowledge. Our results suggest that this biome is not well known, with clusters of quality information near big conservation centres. Environmental variables commonly referred to as indicators of species richness were not correlated to inventory completeness, but when only well-sampled units were analysed, mammalsâ€™ rarefaction slopes could be considered correlated with potential evapotranspiration. Impacted regions which are underexplored need urgent investments in sampling efforts so we can know the real biodiversity of this biome and efficiently measure environmental impacts.

Mapping ignorance to uncover shortfalls in the knowledge on global Orthoptera distribution	Rodrigo AntÃ´nio Castro-Souza|Geiziane Tessarolo|Juliana Stropp|JosÃ© Alexandre Diniz-Filho|Richard J.

However, this and other aspects of biodiversity knowledge suffer from shortcomings and biases. Quantifying and mapping biodiversity knowledge shortfalls is therefore crucial to ascertain the current quality and completeness of biodiversity data, prioritize sites for (re)sampling, or plan conservation interventions. Here, we compile a comprehensive dataset of Orthoptera occurrences, and use it to create a global â€˜ignorance mapâ€™ based on taxonomic, survey and temporal completeness, and on survey and temporal evenness of the inventories. We hypothesize that knowledge of Orthopteran biodiversity is relatively poorer in tropical regions compared to temperate regions, and in the south compared to the northern hemisphere. Due to biocultural factors, we expect regions in the tropics and the Global South to have lower levels of completeness and evenness in time and space for all the studied aspects of biodiversity information. Our findings show gaps in the knowledge of orthopteran distributions, which are characterized by low survey and temporal evenness in tropical regions, but also in many temperate regions (e.g., most of the countries in temperate Asia). The combination of multiple dimensions of biodiversity knowledge (taxonomic, spatial and temporal) reveals that biogeographic interpretations based on only one component can lead to an illusion of completeness. We believe that the novel framework used in our study can guide future research towards building more accessible maps of biogeographical ignorance for entire groups.

Mapping potential conflicts between global agriculture and terrestrial conservation	Nguyen Tien Hoang|Oliver Taherzadeh|Haruka Ohashi|Yusuke Yonekura|Shota Nishijima|Masaki Yamabe|Tetsuya Matsui|Hiroyuki Matsuda|Daniel Moran|Keiichiro Kanemoto	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences	02.06.2023	2023-05-30T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI		NORWAY|JAPAN|NETHERLANDS		JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2208376120	10.1073/pnas.2208376120	4699310f-d917-3ee2-939f-efa35b33f96a	Demand for food products, often from international trade, has brought agricultural land use into direct competition with biodiversity. Where these potential conflicts occur and which consumers are responsible is poorly understood. By combining conservation priority (CP) maps with agricultural trade data, we estimate current potential conservation risk hotspots driven by 197 countries across 48 agricultural products. Globally, a third of agricultural production occurs in sites of high CP (CP > 0.75, max = 1.0). While cattle, maize, rice, and soybean pose the greatest threat to very high-CP sites, other low-conservation risk products (e.g., sugar beet, pearl millet, and sunflower) currently are less likely to be grown in sites of agricultureâ€“conservation conflict. Our analysis suggests that a commodity can cause dissimilar conservation threats in different production regions. Accordingly, some of the conservation risks posed by different countries depend on their demand and sourcing patterns of agricultural commodities. Our spatial analyses identify potential hotspots of competition between agriculture and high-conservation value sites (i.e., 0.5Â° resolution, or ~367 to 3,077km2, grid cells containing both agriculture and high-biodiversity priority habitat), thereby providing additional information that could help prioritize conservation activities and safeguard biodiversity in individual countries and globally. A web-based GIS tool at https://agriculture.spatialfootprint.com/biodiversity/ systematically visualizes the results of our analyses.

Measuring the impact of biodiversity datasets: data reuse, citations and altmetrics	Nushrat Khan|Mike Thelwall|Kayvan Kousha	Scientometrics	03.11.2021	2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z	false	true	DOI		UNITED_KINGDOM	Altmetrics|Citation analysis|Citation practice|Data reuse|Open biodiversity data	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-021-03890-6	10.1007/s11192-021-03890-6	c3781b58-aa6d-39a7-95ad-ab230900fcad	Despite growing evidence of open biodiversity data reuse by scientists, information about how data is reused and cited is rarely openly accessible from research data repositories. This study explores data citation and reuse practices in biodiversity by using openly available metadata for 43,802 datasets indexed in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and content analyses of articles citing GBIF data. Results from quantitative and content analyses suggest that even though the number of studies making use of openly available biodiversity data has been increasing steadily, best practice for data citation is not yet common. It is encouraging, however, that an increasing number of recent articles (16 out of 23 in 2019) in biodiversity cite datasets in a standard way. A content analysis of a random sample of unique citing articles (nâ€‰=â€‰100) found various types of background (nâ€‰=â€‰18) and foreground (nâ€‰=â€‰81) reuse cases for GBIF data, ranging from combining with other data sources to create species distribution modelling to software testing. This demonstrates some unique research opportunities created by open data. Among the citing articles, 27% mentioned the dataset in references and 13% in data access statements in addition to the methods section. Citation practice was inconsistent especially when a large number of subsets (12â€‰~â€‰50) were used. Even though many GBIF dataset records had altmetric scores, most posts only mentioned the articles linked to those datasets. Among the altmetric mentions of datasets, blogs can be the most informative, even though rare, and most tweets and Facebook posts were for promotional purposes.

We aimed to assess how a comparatively simple method based on sequencing environmental DNA (eDNA) characterises global variation in plant diversity and community composition compared with data derived from traditional plant inventory methods.MethodsWe sequenced a short fragment (P6 loop) of the chloroplast trnL intron from from 325 globally distributed soil samples and compared estimates of diversity and composition with those derived from traditional sources based on empirical (GBIF) or extrapolated plant distribution and diversity data.ResultsLarge-scale plant diversity and community composition patterns revealed by sequencing eDNA were broadly in accordance with those derived from traditional sources. The success of the eDNA taxonomy assignment, and the overlap of taxon lists between eDNA and GBIF, was greatest at moderate to high latitudes of the northern hemisphere. On average, around half (mean: 51.5% SD 17.6) of local GBIF records were represented in eDNA databases at the species level, depending on the geographic region.DiscussioneDNA trnL gene sequencing data accurately represent global patterns in plant diversity and composition and thus can provide a basis for large-scale vegetation studies. Important experimental considerations for plant eDNA studies include using a sampling volume and design to maximise the number of taxa detected and optimising the sequencing depth. However, increasing the coverage of reference sequence databases would yield the most significant improvements in the accuracy of taxonomic assignments made using the P6 loop of the trnL region.

Mining data from legacy taxonomic literature and application for sampling spiders of the Teutamus group (Araneae; Liocranidae) in Southeast Asia	F. Andres Rivera-Quiroz|Booppa Petcharad|Jeremy A. Miller	Scientific Reports	27.09.2020	2020-09-25T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI		NETHERLANDS|SWITZERLAND|THAILAND		JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-72549-8	10.1038/s41598-020-72549-8	ad0ebadc-98ac-39c8-8a5e-a2c2c7d18db7	Taxonomic literature contains information about virtually ever known species on Earth. In many cases, all that is known about a taxon is contained in this kind of literature, particularly for the most diverse and understudied groups. Taxonomic publications in the aggregate have documented a vast amount of specimen data. Among other things, these data constitute evidence of the existence of a particular taxon within a spatial and temporal context. When knowledge about a particular taxonomic group is rudimentary, investigators motivated to contribute new knowledge can use legacy records to guide them in their search for new specimens in the field. However, these legacy data are in the form of unstructured text, making it difficult to extract and analyze without a human interpreter. Here, we used a combination of semi-automatic tools to extract and categorize specimen data from taxonomic literature of one family of ground spiders (Liocranidae). We tested the application of these data on fieldwork optimization, using the relative abundance of adult specimens reported in literature as a proxy to find the best times and places for collecting the species (Teutamus politus) and its relatives (Teutamus group, TG) within Southeast Asia. Based on these analyses we decided to collect in three provinces in Thailand during the months of June and August. With our approach, we were able to collect more specimens of T. politus (188 specimens, 95 adults) than all the previous records in literature combined (102 specimens). Our approach was also effective for sampling other representatives of the TG, yielding at least one representative of every TG genus previously reported for Thailand. In total, our samples contributed 231 specimens (134 adults) to the 351 specimens previously reported in the literature for this country. Our results exemplify one application of mined literature data that allows investigators to more efficiently allocate effort and resources for the study of neglected, endangered, or interesting taxa and geographic areas. Furthermore, the integrative workflow demonstrated here shares specimen data with global online resources like Plazi and GBIF, meaning that others can freely reuse these data and contribute to them in the future. The contributions of the present study represent an increase of more than 35% on the taxonomic coverage of the TG in GBIF based on the number of species. Also, our extracted data represents 72% of the occurrences now available through GBIF for the TG and more than 85% of occurrences of T. politus. Taxonomic literature is a key source of undigitized biodiversity data for taxonomic groups that are underrepresented in the current biodiversity data sphere. Mobilizing these data is key to understanding and protecting some of the less well-known domains of biodiversity.

This includes documenting historical genetic erosion and extinction, discovering species new to science, resolving evolutionary relationships, investigating epigenetic effects, and determining origins of infectious diseases. However, the development of best-practices in isolating, processing, and analyzing hDNA remain under-explored, due to the substantial diversity of specimen preparation types, tissue sources, archival ages, and collecting histories. Thus, for hDNA to reach its full potential, and justify the destructive sampling of the rarest specimens, more experimental work using time-series collections, and the development of improved methods to correct for data asymmetries and biases due to DNA degradation are required.

There are, however, large gaps in biological sampling and hence knowledge shortfalls. This problem is even more pronounced in the tropics. Indeed, the use of only a few taxonomic groups or environmental surrogates for modelling biodiversity is not viable in mega-diverse countries, such as Brazil. To overcome these limitations, we developed a comprehensive spatial model that includes phylogenetic information and other several biodiversity dimensions aimed at mapping areas with high relevance for biodiversity conservation. Our model applies a genetic algorithm tool for identifying the smallest possible region within a unique biota that contains the most number of species and phylogenetic diversity, as well as the highest endemicity and phylogenetic endemism. The model successfully pinpoints small highly biodiverse areas alongside regions with knowledge shortfalls where further sampling should be conducted. Our results suggest that conservation strategies should consider several taxonomic groups, the multiple dimensions of biodiversity, and associated sampling uncertainties.

Therefore, it has an essential role to play in the transition towards a more sustainable agriculture. For the prediction of natural pest control, it is essential to understand the distribution of the species providing this ecosystem service. The presence of pests and natural enemies depends on a combination of abiotic and biotic factors, each playing a determining role at different spatial scales. We developed a hierarchical model composed of environmental predictors including bioclimatic and land use variables at the European scale, as well as landscape complexity and biotic interactions at the landscape scale. This paper presents the predicted distribution of 111 species from seven different arthropod families (two pest aphid species and their natural enemy species) in an agricultural region in northern Germany. The hierarchical framework allows determining the capacity of landscapes to support pest control ecosystem services provided by arthropods at the local scale and informs on vulnerable areas or potential mismatches between natural pest control demand and supply. Thereby it can support the design of local scale measures for habitat improvement, biodiversity conservation and the increase of ecosystem services supply. The hierarchical approach can be adapted to other agroecosystems and leaves potential for further adaptations to improve the prediction of pests and their natural enemy distribution, dynamics and factors influencing their spatial distribution.

Classification of Lepidagathis and Lophostachys has been under debate for a long period. Earlier, they were separated based on their distribution and morphology. However, according to Benoist 1911, the morphological differences were very slight; hence, both were considered under the genus Lepidagathis. Molecular analysis is the most effective method to clear up taxonomic issues, but more data is needed regarding Lepidagathis and Lophostachys. Lepidagathis cristata, the type species of this genus, has no molecular sequences available. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to sequence several plastid markers, which are frequently employed for the phylogeny of Acanthaceae and species DNA barcoding. Subsequently, phylogenetic trees using Bayesian and maximum likelihood bootstrap methods were built. The predominantly Asian species formed a clade which we characterize as Lepidagathis s.s was found monophyletic with strong Bayesian posterior probability support as well as good maximum-likelihood bootstrap support. Lepidagathis s.s was sister to another well-supported clade consisting of the genus Lophostachys. This phylogenetic study, along with the biogeographical distribution proves that Lepidagathis and Lophostachys are independently evolving clades, which can be treated as different subgenera.

Participatory monitoring drives biodiversity knowledge in global protected areas	Caitlin P. Mandeville|Erlend B. Nilsen|Ivar Herfindal|Anders G.

Effective area-based conservation relies on biodiversity data, but the current biodiversity knowledge base is insufficient and limited by geographic and taxonomic biases. Public participation in biodiversity monitoring such as via community-based monitoring or citizen science increases data collection but also contributes to replicating these biases or introducing new ones. Here we examine how participatory monitoring has changed the landscape of open biodiversity knowledge in protected areas using biodiversity data shared on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. We highlight a growing dominance of participatory monitoring within protected areas. We find that patterns in geographic, taxonomic, and threatened species coverage differ from non-participatory monitoring, suggesting complementarity between the two approaches. The relative contribution of participatory monitoring varies with characteristics of both protected areas and monitoring programs. We synthesize these results to derive context-specific strategies for extending the conservation impact of participatory biodiversity monitoring. Participatory monitoring such as citizen science can expand the range of species covered by standard monitoring approaches and improve knowledge of species biodiversity in protected areas, according to an analysis of Global Biodiversity Information Facility data over 2000-2021.

Focusing on patterns of introductions can provide insights as to underlying mechanisms that facilitate establishment, and in turn, their potential effects on native communities. The brown widow spider, Latrodectus geometricus C. L. Koch, 1841, is likely native to Africa, but now has a cosmopolitan distribution due to introductions via international trade. We reviewed the patterns of brown widow introductions in the Americas to determine if there are any large-scale inferences regarding their patterns, and potential impacts, of their introduction. A total of 5,004 records from 30 countries were synthesized and demonstrate their spread to higher latitudes across time with the majority of those records (n = 4,923; 98%) occurring in the past two decades. Brown widows are now documented in 30 of the 35 countries in North, Central, and South America, with one-third of those introductions detected in the last 30 years. Citizen-science databases (e.g., iNaturalist) have been instrumental in documenting the expansion of the brown widow, as more than 90% of the records synthesized came from these sources. Brown widows have proven to be successful invaders worldwide, and this review synthesizes expansion reports of their invasion in the Americas in hopes of spurring additional research in locations where they have become established.

More than 40,000 phylogeographic and population genetic investigations have been published to date, each collecting genetic data from hundreds of samples. Despite these millions of data points, meta-analyses are challenging because the synthesis of results across hundreds of studies, each using different methods and forms of analysis, is a daunting and time-consuming task. It is more efficient to proceed by repurposing existing data and using automated data analysis. To facilitate data repurposing, we created a database (phylogatR) that aggregates data from different sources and conducts automated multiple sequence alignments and data curation to provide users with nearly ready-to-analyze sets of data for thousands of species. Two types of scientific research will be made easier by phylogatR, large meta-analyses of thousands of species that can address classic questions in evolutionary biology and ecology and student- or citizen-science based investigations that will introduce a broad range of people to the analysis of genetic data. phylogatR enhances the value of existing data via the creation of software and web-based tools that enable these data to be recycled and reanalyzed and increase accessibility to big data for research labs and classroom instructors with limited computational expertise and resources.

Phylogenetic diversity and North Andean block conservation	Omar Daniel Leon-Alvarado|Daniel R.

Nevertheless, the settlement of several human populations has triggered the rapid transformation of ecosystems, leading to the extinction or endangerment of many species.   Methods Because phylogenetic diversity indices quantify the historical distinctness between species, they are adequate tools for evaluating priority conservation areas. We reconstructed 93 phylogenies encompassing 1,252 species and, utilizing their occurrence data sourced from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, computed the Average Taxonomic Distinctness Index (AvTD) for each grid cell with a spatial resolution of 0.25Â° within the NAB. The index values for each grid cell were categorized into quantiles, and grid cells displaying values within the upper quantile (Q5) were identified as the most significant in terms of phylogenetic diversity. We also calculated the contribution of endemic species to overall phylogenetic diversity within the NAB, specifically focusing on areas preserved within protected areas.   Results The NAB Andean region exhibited the highest AvTD, with high AvTD values observed in the middle and southern areas of Cordilleras. Endemic species made a relatively modest contribution to the overall phylogenetic diversity of the NAB, accounting for only 1.2% of the total. Despite their relatively small geographical footprints, protected areas within the NAB have emerged as crucial repositories of biodiversity, encompassing 40% of the total phylogenetic diversity in the region.   Discussion Although the NAB Andean region has been identified as the most crucial area in terms of AvTD, some regions in the Amazonian Piedemonte and Pacific lowlands have high AvTD levels. Interestingly, some protected areas have been found to harbor higher AvTDs than expected, given their smaller size. Although the delimitation of new PAs and species richness have been the primary factors driving the expansion of PAs, it is also essential to consider the evolutionary information of species to conserve all aspects of biodiversity, or at least cover most of them. Therefore, using phylogenetic diversity measures and the results of this study can contribute to expanding the PA network and improving the connectivity between PAs. This approach will help conserve different aspects of biodiversity and preserve evolutionary relationships between species.

This includes 25 outgroups and 133 araneid ingroups representing the subfamilies Zygiellinae Simon, 1929, Nephilinae Simon, 1894, and the typical araneids, here informally named the â€œARA Cladeâ€. The araneid genera analysed here include roughly 90% of all currently named araneid species. The ARA Clade is the primary focus of this analysis. In taxonomic terms, outgroups comprise 22 genera and 11 families, and the ingroup comprises three Zygiellinae and four Nephilinae genera, and 85 ARA Clade genera (ten new). Within the ARA Clade, we recognize ten informal groups that contain at least three genera each and are supported under Bayesian posterior probabilities (â‰¥ 0.95): â€œCaerostrinesâ€ (Caerostris, Gnolus and Testudinaria), â€œMicratheninesâ€ (Acacesia, Micrathena, Ocrepeira, Scoloderus and Verrucosa), â€œEriophorinesâ€ (Acanthepeira, Alpaida, Eriophora, Parawixia and Wagneriana), â€œBackobourkiinesâ€ (Acroaspis, Backobourkia, Carepalxis, Novakiella, Parawixia, Plebs, Singa and three new genera), â€œArgiopinesâ€ (Arachnura, Acusilas, Argiope, Cyrtophora, Gea, Lariniaria and Mecynogea), â€œCyrtarachninesâ€ (Aranoethra, Cyrtarachne, Paraplectana, Pasilobus and Poecilopachys), â€œMastophorinesâ€ (Celaenia, Exechocentrus and Mastophora,), â€œNucteninesâ€ (Larinia, Larinioides and Nuctenea), â€œZealaraneinesâ€ (Colaranea, Cryptaranea, Paralarinia, Zealaranea and two new genera) and â€œGasteracanthinesâ€ (Augusta, Acrosomoides, Austracantha, Gasteracantha, Isoxya, Macracantha, Madacantha, Parmatergus and Thelacantha). Few of these groups are currently corroborated by morphology, behaviour, natural history or biogeography. We also include the large genus Araneus, along with Aculepeira, Agalenatea, Anepsion, Araniella, Cercidia, Chorizopes, Cyclosa, Dolophones, Eriovixia, Eustala, Gibbaranea, Hingstepeira, Hypognatha, Kaira, Larinia, Mangora, Metazygia, Metepeira, Neoscona, Paraplectanoides, Perilla, Poltys, Pycnacantha, Spilasma and Telaprocera, but the placement of these genera was generally ambiguous, except for Paraplectanoides, which is strongly supported as sister to traditional Nephilinae. Araneus, Argiope, Eriophora and Larinia are polyphyletic, Araneus implying nine new taxa of genus rank, and Eriophora and Larinia two each. In Araneus and Eriophora, polyphyly was usually due to north temperate generic concepts being used as dumping grounds for species from southern hemisphere regions, e.g. Southâ€East Asia, Australia or New Zealand. Although Araneidae is one of the better studied spider families, too little natural history and/or morphological data are available across these terminals to draw any strong evolutionary conclusions. However, the classical orb web is reconstructed as plesiomorphic for Araneidae, with a single loss in â€œcyrtarachninesâ€â€“â€œmastophorinesâ€. Web decorations (collectively known as stabilimenta) evolved perhaps five times. Sexual dimorphism generally results from female body size increase with few exceptions; dimorphic taxa are not monophyletic and revert to monomorphism in a few cases.

Are such datasets appropriate to describe composition gradients and Î²â€diversity? When compared with phytosociological data, what are the differences in terms of composition (coâ€occurrence) gradients depending on the considered scale? Location: PÃ¡ramos (Neoâ€tropical alpine ecosystems) of Colombia. Methods: We compared vegetation patterns from phytosociological relevÃ©s and reconstructed pseudoâ€communities from herbarium collections in the Colombian high elevation pÃ¡ramo ecosystem using diversity partitioning and Mantel correlations. Results: Species composition differed in the two datasets, which could be explained by taxonomic bias toward charismatic species and overâ€representation of rare species in the herbarium dataset, whereas common species were more frequently represented in the phytosociological dataset. The two datasets showed a similarly preponderant importance of largeâ€scale differences when we looked at species accumulation across different scales. Small scale richness contributed more to total richness for the phytosociological dataset, while richness at intermediate scales was more important in the herbarium dataset. Finally, pairwise Î²â€diversity analyses did not show correlations between datasets, and common species showed similar ecological distribution patterns. Conclusions: We recommend caution to researchers who wish to describe Î²â€diversity patterns in local communities using only herbarium data. However, since the two datasets showed some complementarity in their composition patterns, we suggest that combining data from relevÃ©s (or plots) and occurrence data (herbarium records, citizen science, etc.) could be an efficient strategy for describing broader diversity patterns. We discuss the circumstances under which it could be advantageous to work with such combined datasets, in particular in relation to conservation issues.

Identifying and understanding taxonomic and geographic knowledge shortfalls is key to prioritising future collection and conservation efforts.Using extensive data for 343 523 vascular plant species and timeâ€toâ€event analyses, we conducted multiple tests related to plant taxonomic and geographic data shortfalls, and identified 33 global diversity darkspots (those â€˜botanical countriesâ€™ predicted to contain most undescribed and not yet recorded species). We defined priority regions for future collection according to several socioâ€economic and environmental scenarios.Most plant diversity darkspots are found within global biodiversity hotspots, with the exception of New Guinea. We identify Colombia, Myanmar, New Guinea, Peru, Philippines and Turkey as global collection priorities under all environmental and socioâ€economic conditions considered.Our study provides a flexible framework to help accelerate the documentation of global plant diversity for the implementation of conservation actions. As digitisation of the world's herbaria progresses, collection and conservation priorities may soon be identifiable at finer scales.

Pleistocene glaciations caused the latitudinal gradient of within-species genetic diversity	Emanuel M Fonseca|Tara A Pelletier|Sydney K Decker|Danielle J Parsons|Bryan C Carstens	Evolution Letters	22.07.2023	2023-07-20T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	generic		UNITED_STATES	Pleistocene glaciation|intraspecific genetic diversity|latitudinal gradient|nucleotide diversity	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1093/evlett/qrad030	10.1093/evlett/qrad030	803b4f8f-692d-3f0f-97f6-cdc4a9da698c	Intraspecific genetic diversity is a key aspect of biodiversity. Quaternary climatic change and glaciation influenced intraspecific genetic diversity by promoting range shifts and population size change. However, the extent to which glaciation affected genetic diversity on a global scale is not well established. Here we quantify nucleotide diversity, a common metric of intraspecific genetic diversity, in more than 38,000 plant and animal species using georeferenced DNA sequences from millions of samples. Results demonstrate that tropical species contain significantly more intraspecific genetic diversity than nontropical species. To explore potential evolutionary processes that may have contributed to this pattern, we calculated summary statistics that measure population demographic change and detected significant correlations between these statistics and latitude. We find that nontropical species are more likely to deviate from neutral expectations, indicating that they have historically experienced dramatic fluctuations in population size likely associated with Pleistocene glacial cycles. By analyzing the most comprehensive data set to date, our results imply that Quaternary climate perturbations may be more important as a process driving the latitudinal gradient in species richness than previously appreciated.

Robust indicators for measuring the status and trends of biological invasions are lacking, but essential for monitoring biological invasions and the effectiveness of interventions. Here, we formulate and demonstrate three such indicators that capture the key dimensions of species invasions, each a significant and necessary advance to inform invasive alien species policy targets: 1) Rate of Invasive Alien Species Spread, which provides modelled rates of ongoing introductions of species based on invasion discovery and reporting. 2) Impact Risk, that estimates invasive alien species impacts on the environment in space and time and provides a basis for nationally targeted prioritization of where best to invest in management efforts. 3) Status Information on invasive alien species, that tracks improvement in the essential dimensions of information needed to guide relevant policy and data collection and in support of assessing invasive alien species spread and impact. We show how proximal, model-informed status and trend indicators on invasive alien species can provide more effective global (and national) reporting on biological invasions, and how countries can contribute to supporting these indicators.

The social spider Anelosimus eximius occurs in tropical rainforests in South America, including in the north and mid-west Amazon, and we have recently found records of its presence in Atlantic Forest, even though the arid features of Cerrado apparently restrict contact between these two areas. In this study we investigated the population history of A. eximius using a spatiotemporal framework. Focusing on biogeographic history, we used sequences of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), to investigate population structure, diversity and time to the most recent common ancestor of the sampled individuals. We aimed to generate ecological niche models to estimate the distribution of the species from the last interglacial to the present. Our results revealed three major clusters in A. eximius (Trans-Andean, Cis-Andean, and French Guiana-Brazil) sharing common ancestors in the Late Pleistocene, c.a. 360 thousand years ago. The last interglacial period revealed a connection between A. eximius populations in Amazonia and the Atlantic forests, through the area currently occupied by the Cerrado. Dispersal over longer distances could be improved by higher rates of propagule production, growth and proliferation of new colonies. This increased dispersal capacity could be provided by wetter environments that promote prey with greater biomass, thus positively impacting the expansion of larger webs.

Associated changes in land use could include conversion of grazing land into horticulture, which makes more efficient use of land per unit of dietary energy and frees-up land for other uses. Methods Here we use Great Britain as a case study to estimate potential impacts on biodiversity from converting grazing land to a mixture of horticulture and natural land covers by fitting species distribution models for over 800 species, including pollinating insects and species of conservation priority. Results Across several land use scenarios that consider the current ratio of domestic fruit and vegetable production to imports, our statistical models suggest a potential for gains to biodiversity, including a tendency for more species to gain habitable area than to lose habitable area. Moreover, the models suggest that climate change impacts on biodiversity could be mitigated to a degree by land use changes associated with dietary shifts. Conclusions Our analysis demonstrates that options exist for changing agricultural land uses in a way that can generate win-win-win outcomes for biodiversity, adaptation to climate change and public health.

Predicting IUCN conservation status through machine learning: a case study on reptiles	NÃ¡dia Filipa de Jesus Soares		28.01.2022	2021-11-30T00:00:00.000Z	false	false	DOI		PORTUGAL		THESIS	https://hdl.handle.net/10216/139425		f71a1715-17d7-3ec5-a63b-aea2655ed1c0	Halting biodiversity loss is the ultimate challenge of our era. We are losing species at a high rate, even before assessing their extinction risk. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List is the most complete assessment of species conservation status, yet it only covers around 138,374 out of about 1.2 million species identified so far. Additionally, many of those assessments are outdated, due to the ever-evolving nature of taxonomy or lack of resources. These assessments rely on long, mostly manual processes performed by experts. Species conservation would gain by automating the identification of species where experts and financing should focus on. This work proposes a pipeline to derive datasets out of open data and obtain conservation status predictions, through machine learning, of Not Evaluated (NE) and Data Deficient (DD) species. This pipeline was applied to different groups within the Reptilia class, one of the most under-assessed taxonomic group of vertebrates, and the performance of different machine learning algorithms was compared using five datasets. The first included only two variables (the most used in IUCN assessments) â€“ extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO). The second used only ecological variables, the third used all available variables, and the fourth and fifth variations of the latter two using variable selection. Additionally, SMOTE was used to balance the datasets where the class of interest was the minority, and improve the results for the species in that class. The predictions were mapped to locate threatspots and needed conservation assessments, and to infer global patterns. The results showed that EOO and AOO are the most relevant predictors of threat status achieving good results when used alone in models. Nevertheless, most groups benefited from the inclusion of ecogeographical variables together with those two. Random Forest was the best method for most groups and variable selection improved results. The predictions, when compared to the most recent assessments, achieved good sensitivity and specificity results. The threatspot maps showed that the areas with threatened species may be larger than previously thought, especially in Africa and Brazil. Overall, results support that the developed pipeline can be used to perform a general model assisted conservation status assessment across species to more efficiently allocate conservation efforts, which more focused studies can then complement.

However, assessments of future range shifts rarely account for the capacity of the landscape matrix to facilitate species dispersals. Here, we assessed future range shifts for a suite of critically endangered plants in Madagascar. We quantified habitat connectivity using a least cost path model that captured the potential of species to disperse within fragmented landscapes. Next, we constructed three scenarios representing landscapes impacted by climate-only, climate and land-cover change, as well as habitat connectivity. We modelled species distributions using a hierarchical Bayesian framework and measured future range shifts using three spatial indices: net-change, range distance and elevation change. Our results show that the median range shift due to contractions increased by 25% under the climate-only scenario compared with the connectivity scenario. Habitat connectivity is predicted to limit range shifts due to contractions, while increasing shifts due to expansions for many of the endangered and critically endangered plants on Madagascar. However, at least one-third of critically endangered and 50% of endangered plants are expected to experience range contractions and upslope displacement under all scenarios, suggesting that even with habitat connectivity the range of some species may still contract. Despite that finding, our study suggests that including connectivity in range shift models is crucial for developing a relevant connectivity conservation plan, since future climate or climate and land-cover change models do not adequately represent species' potential to reach safe sites.

Yet, most regions/countries currently lack comprehensive climateâ€driven biodiversity projections across taxonomic groups, challenging effective conservation efforts. To address this gap, our study evaluated the potential effects of climate change on the biodiversity of an alpine country of Europe, Switzerland. We used a stateâ€ofâ€the art species distribution modeling approach and species occurrence data that covered the climatic conditions encountered across the full species' ranges to help limiting niche truncation. We quantified the relationship between baseline climate and the spatial distribution of 7291 species from 12 main taxonomic groups and projected future climate suitability for three 30â€year periods and two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios (RCP4.5 and 8.5). Our results indicated important effects of projected climate changes on species' climate suitability, with responses varying by the taxonomic and conservation status group. The percentage of species facing major changes in climate suitability was higher under RCP8.5 (68%) compared to RCP4.5 (66%). By the end of the century, decreases in climate suitability were projected for 3000 species under RCP8.5 and 1758 species under RCP4.5. The most affected groups under RCP8.5 were molluscs, algae, and amphibians, while it was molluscs, birds, and vascular plants under RCP4.5. Spatially, by 2070â€“2099, we projected an overall decrease in climate suitability for 39% of the cells in the study area under RCP8.5 and 10% under RCP4.5, while projecting an increase for 50% of the cells under RCP8.5 and 73% under RCP4.5. The most consistent geographical shifts were upward, southward, and eastward. We found that the coverage of high climate suitability cells by protected areas was expected to increase. Our models and maps provide guidance for spatial conservation planning by pointing out future climateâ€suitable areas for biodiversity.

However, data on species distributions is often patchy, especially in many countries of the Global South where resources for biological surveys have been historically limited. In this study, we use biodiversity ignorance scores to quantify and visualize gaps and biases in biodiversity data for Namibia, with a focus on five terrestrial taxa at a spatial scale of 10Â xÂ 10Â km. We model the relationship between ignorance scores and socio-geographical variables using generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS). Our findings demonstrate that despite a high volume of occurrence records available on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), publicly available knowledge of Namibia's terrestrial biodiversity remains very limited, with large areas contributing few or no records for key taxa. The exception is birds that have benefitted from a massive influx of data from the citizen science platform eBird. Our study also highlights the importance of citizen science initiatives for biodiversity knowledge and reinforces the usefulness of ignorance scores as a simple intuitive indicator of the relative availability and distribution of species occurrence records. However, further research, biological surveys, and renewed efforts to make existing data held by museums and other institutions widely available are still necessary to enhance biodiversity data coverage in countries with patchy data.

However, inverse LDGs, in which species richness peaks in extratropical regions, are also found in some lineages and their causes remain unclear. Here, we test the roles of evolutionary time, diversification rates, and niche conservatism in explaining the inverse LDG of Potentilla (ca. 500 species). We compiled the global distributions of ~â€‰90% of Potentilla species, and reconstructed a robust phylogenetic framework based on whole-plastome sequences. Next, we analyzed the divergence time, ancestral area, diversification rate, and ancestral niche to investigate the macroevolutionary history of Potentilla . Results The genus originated in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau during the late Eocene and gradually spread to other regions of the Northern Hemisphere posterior to the late Miocene. Rapid cooling after the late Pliocene promoted the radiating diversification of Potentilla . The polyploidization, as well as some cold-adaptive morphological innovations, enhanced the adaptation of Potentilla species to the cold environment. Ancestral niche reconstruction suggests that Potentilla likely originated in a relatively cool environment. The species richness peaks at approximately 45 Â°N, a region characterized by high diversification rates, and the environmental conditions are similar to the ancestral climate niche. Evolutionary time was not significantly correlated with species richness in the latitudinal gradient. Conclusions Our results suggest that the elevated diversification rates in middle latitude regions and the conservatism in thermal niches jointly determined the inverse LDG in Potentilla . This study highlights the importance of integrating evolutionary and ecological approaches to explain the diversity pattern of biological groups on a global scale.

Range size predicts the risk of local extinction from habitat loss	Ingmar R. Staude|Laetitia M. Navarro|Henrique M. Pereira	Global Ecology and Biogeography	19.09.2019	2019-09-13T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI		GERMANY	biotic homogenization|persistence|range size|spatial species turnover|temporal species turnover	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13003	10.1111/geb.13003	43d5c2ea-b83f-31e8-8ab4-acf18ad11e58	Aim: The geographical range size of species is a strong predictor of vulnerability to global extinction. However, it remains unclear whether range size is also a good predictor of extinction risk at much smaller scales. Here, we reconstruct biodiversity time series to ask whether species with small ranges have declined preferentially with habitat loss at the local scale. Location: Global. Time period: 1500â€“2015. Major taxa studied: Vascular plants. Method: We collated 70 million occurrence records of 180,000 species of vascular plants from three biodiversity dataâ€sharing networks. We combined these with data on changes in global land use to find locations (0.25Â° grid cells) with biodiversity data before and after loss of natural habitat. First, we examined the change in community median range size before and after habitat loss. Second, we quantified the probabilities of local persistence of smallâ€ and largeâ€ranged species at different levels of habitat loss. Results: Community median range size was higher after habitat loss, on average. Species with small ranges had lower probabilities of persistence than species with large ranges at already moderate habitat loss (â‰¤50%). Main conclusions: The loss of natural habitat has a differential effect on the local extinction risk of species with different range sizes. Given that species with small ranges decline preferentially, habitat loss can create a linkage between temporal and spatial species turnover, in that changes within communities decrease compositional differences between communities.

Re-assessing niche partitioning in MacArthurâ€™s Warblers: foraging behavior, morphology, and diet metabarcoding in a phylogenetic context	E. T. Miller|A. Wood|M. D. Baiz|A. J. Welch|R. C. Fleischer|A. S. Dale|D. P. Toews	bioRxiv	30.08.2022	2022-08-29T00:00:00.000Z	true	false	DOI		UNITED_KINGDOM		WORKING_PAPER	https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.26.505503	10.1101/2022.08.26.505503	22c52ef9-7d21-3381-9e5e-c13c415970db	Due in large part to MacArthurs classic 1958 paper, wood-warblers (Parulidae) are ecological icons, textbook protagonists of a story of competition and niche partitioning. As the story goes, subtle differences in foraging behavior are the principal means by which these nearly morphologically indistinguishable species are able to co-occur and avoid extinction. Yet, MacArthurs study was in fact quite limited in scale, and he said little about the relevance of evolution to the study system. Here, we reassess MacArthurs conclusions across an expanded set of syntopic warbler species in a forest in northern New York. We combine morphometrics, quantitative foraging data, and fecal metabarcoding--a direct measure of warbler diet--to study competition and niche partitioning in an evolutionary framework. We find close and kinematically realistic relationships between morphology and foraging behavior, but little connection between warbler ecomorphology and the 2,882 invertebrate taxa detected in their diets. Instead, diet remains phylogenetically conserved--closely related warblers eat similar suites of invertebrates, regardless of where they forage. Finally, we present evidence that these species not only partition niche space in the present day, but that competition has shaped their behaviors over evolutionary time. MacArthur (1958) may have drawn a few incorrect inferences, but his overall conclusion that evolved differences in foraging position, driven by competition among close relatives, does indeed appear to be a key reason these warblers can occur in such close sympatry.

Reassessment of the risks of climate change for terrestrial ecosystems	T. Conradi|U. Eggli|H. Kreft|A. H. Schweiger|P. Weigelt|S. I. Higgins	bioRxiv	28.10.2023	2023-10-27T00:00:00.000Z	false	false	DOI		GERMANY|SWITZERLAND		WORKING_PAPER	https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.24.563567	10.1101/2023.10.24.563567	ca44cf16-77fd-3626-8567-beff1823472f	Forecasting the risks of climate change for species and ecosystems is necessary for developing targeted conservation strategies. Previous risk assessments mapped the exposure of the global land surface to changes in climate1-4 However, this procedure is unlikely to robustly identify priority areas for conservation actions because non-linear physiological responses and co-limitation processes ensure that ecological changes will not map perfectly to the forecast climatic changes. Here, we combine ecophysio{-}logical growth models of 135,153 vascular plant species and plant growth form information to transform ambient and future climatologies into phytoclimates, which describe the ability of climates to support the plant growth forms that characterise terrestrial ecosystems. We forecast that 33% to 68% of the global land surface will experience a significant change in phytoclimate by 2070 under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, respectively. Novel phytoclimates without present-day analogue are forecast to emerge on 0.3-2.2% of the land surface, and 0.1-1.3% of currently realised phytoclimates are forecast to disappear. Notably, the geographic pattern of change, disappearance and novelty of phytoclimates differs markedly from the pattern of analogous trends in climates detected by previous studies1,3,4, thereby defining new priorities for conservation actions and highlighting the limits of using untransformed climate change exposure indices in ecologicaI risk assessments. Our findings suggest that a profound transformation of the biosphere is underway and emphasise the need for a timely adaptation of biodiversity management practices.

Recognition and completeness metrics from iNaturalist and GBIF can inform future citizen science and research projects: a case study on arthropods in Namibia	Martha Alfeus|John Irish|Klaus Birkhofer	Biodiversity and Conservation	29.11.2024	2024-11-22T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI	NAMIBIA	GERMANY|NAMIBIA	Biodiversity|Conservation|Insects|Invertebrates|Namibian Biodiversity Database (NBD)	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-024-02981-z	10.1007/s10531-024-02981-z	81eace44-9bfb-3a07-9ece-44d83cfd2d3d	Arthropods are the most diverse animal phylum and play crucial roles in ecosystem functioning through their contributions to ecosystem processes. Accurate knowledge about their distribution and diversity is essential for effective ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation. Public biodiversity databases and citizen science records could contribute to our understanding of arthropod diversity. To test this assumption, we extracted arthropod observations in Namibia from iNaturalist (iNat) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and compared these data to the records in the Namibian Biodiversity Database (NBD). We assessed the proportion of observations identified to species level in each arthropod order in iNat and GBIF (â€œrecognitionâ€ metric) and compared the number of species from the two biodiversity networks (iNat and GBIF) to the known species richness in each arthropod order in NBD (â€œcompletenessâ€ metric). Only 54.4% of iNat and 63.1% of GBIF arthropod observations in Namibia are recorded at species level. Scorpions (Scorpiones) and dragonflies (Odonata) are the most recognised orders in both GBIF and iNat, with high completeness rates (>â€‰60%). However, overall recognition and completeness for all arthropod orders were generally below 50% in both databases. The high recognition and completeness for certain orders could be attributed to species traits that make them recognizable (e.g. large body size, colouration), a low species richness and the taxonomic familiarity of the public. While global biodiversity networks provide valuable data, regional or national databases like NBD remain essential for comprehensive biodiversity understanding. Global biodiversity networks provide insights into public perception and the suitability of taxonomic groups for citizen-involved biodiversity projects.

Reconstructing historical shifts in suitable habitat of Sceloporus lineages using phylogenetic niche modelling	Julio A. Rivera|A. Michelle Lawing|EmÃ­lia P.

We aim to enhance phylogenetic niche models of past suitable habitats for Sceloporus lineages by integrating modern and fossil occurrences with ecological and phylogenetic comparative modelling methods. Specifically, we hypothesized that our integrated approach is sensitive enough to detect geographical shifts in suitable habitat between lineages and through evolutionary time. Location: North America. Taxon: Sceloporus lizards. Methods: We used extant and fossil occurrence data, general circulation models of palaeoclimate, climate envelope modelling and phylogenetic comparative methods to reconstruct past suitable climates for Sceloporus lizards over the last 20 million years, and then visualized the geographical locations of individual lineages using multivariate environmental similarity surfaces (MESS) maps. Results: We were able to reconstruct ancestral suitable climate for Sceloporus lineages with sufficient resolution to identify shifts in geographical location between lineages. We found that large shifts in climate regimes drove the expansion and contraction of suitable habitat through time. We found a positive association between tectonic events, like mountain uplift, and lineage diversification in the Sceloporus clade. Mountain uplift also facilitated the emergence of open grassland habitat, which excluded many Sceloporus species. Main conclusions Our approach was sensitive enough to detect differences in geographical location of suitable habitat across lineages and through evolutionary time. Doing so is a critical first step to tracking the evolutionary ecology of individual taxa over long periods of evolutionary time, and to inferring which species coâ€existed in which locations. Such inferences would allow for more precise predictions of current and future ecological needs for conservation efforts, and to inform efforts to mitigate climate change.

Reconstruction of palaeoenvironmental conditions that led to the formation of Eocene sub-bituminous coal seams in the Hungarian Paleogene Basin	Attila J. TrÃ¡jer	Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology	16.02.2024	2024-04-30T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI		HUNGARY	Coexistence Method|Eocene|Paleoclimate|Plant genera|Sub-bituminous coal	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2024.105080	10.1016/j.revpalbo.2024.105080	2d807bda-8a6b-388f-918e-b4aca0f86806	Although in the second half of the Eocene, thick sub-bituminous coal seams were deposited in the Hungarian Paleogene Basin, it is not known under what climatic conditions these strata were formed. To investigate this, the paleoenvironmental conditions were reconstructed for the upper Lutetian-middle Priabonian period. The reconstruction of paleoclimatic conditions was based on the Coexistence Approach, for which the climatic data of the extant relatives of 15 fossil plant genera provided the basis of the analysis. Most (87%) of the extant relatives of the studied fossil plant genera can be found most frequently in tropical climate regions. Plotting the reconstructed average mean annual temperature (23.4Â Â±Â 3.9Â Â°C) and precipitation (2375Â mmÂ Â±Â 964Â mm) values to the Whittaker Plot and Peltier's plots it was found that the region had a tropical monsoon climate during the upper Lutetian- middle Priabonian period. At the same time, there was a great difference between the precipitation sums of the wettest and driest months (409Â Â±Â 178Â mm and 59Â Â±Â 56Â mm), indicating a tropical monsoon-like climate with strong chemical weathering conditions. Currently, in climatically similar regions, tropical rainforest and tropical moist deciduous forest vegetation grow under tropical rainforest and tropical monsoon climates, and lateritic soils are formed. Furthermore, relatively rich mangrove plant associations flourish along the coasts of these regions, indicating that a part of the peat may have been deposited in mangroves. The contemporary lateritic soils, which later became the protoliths of bauxites, provided a poor nutrient supply for coastal vegetation, likely due to peat accumulation.

Here, we used an extensive dataset of 238 metacommunity time series of multiple taxa spread across the globe to evaluate whether species that are more widespread (large-ranged species) differed in how they changed their site occupancy over the 10â€“90 years the metacommunities were monitored relative to species that are more narrowly distributed (small-ranged species). We found that on average, large-ranged species tended to increase in occupancy through time, whereas small-ranged species tended to decrease. These relationships were stronger in marine than in terrestrial and freshwater realms. However, in terrestrial regions, the directional changes in occupancy were less extreme in protected areas. Our findings provide evidence for systematic decreases in occupancy of small-ranged species, and that habitat protection could mitigate these losses in the face of environmental change. Whether a species declines under the current biodiversity crisis could partly depend on its range size. Here, the authors use replicated metacommunity data to identify global patterns in the relationship between speciesâ€™ range size and changes in occupancy through time.

Report on the observed climate, projected climate, and projected  biodiversity changes for Necedah National Wildlife Refuge, Wisconsin under differing levels of warming	Jeff Price|Nicole ForstenhÃ¤usler|Erin Graham|Timothy J. Osborn|Rachel Warren	Zenodo	27.06.2024	2024-06-11T00:00:00.000Z	true	false	DOI	UNITED_STATES	UNITED_KINGDOM		REPORT	https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12087618	10.5281/zenodo.12087618	bc02b528-9003-3183-80c2-9087d36fc7b6	Necedah National Wildlife Refuge is among the top 20% of all non-marine protected areas, globally. This refuge is projected to be largely resilient to climate change with warming to 2Â°C.Â  With 3Â°C of warming the resiliency drops with some additional adaptation effort needed.Â  At warming levels above 3Â°C, adaptation efforts will need substantially greater effort, especially in many of the western parts of the refuge.Â  Averaged over the entire area of the refuge, with 4Â°C warming (global, above pre-industrial), the area is projected to remain climatically suitable for 69% of its terrestrial biodiversity (fungi, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates), with none of its area remaining an overall refugia (remaining climatically suitable for >75% of the species) for biodiversity. If warming levels were held to 2Â°C, 100% of the area would remain a climatic refugia and the area would remain climatically suitable for 83.6% of its terrestrial biodiversity.  Between 1961-1990 and 1991-2020 the average monthly temperature has increased by 0.2Â° - 2.1Â°C. With warming levels of 2.0Â°C the new average monthly temperature is equivalent to that only seen 1 in 3 years in 1961-1990 for April -November (up to 1 in 20 years for July - September). Most months have seen increases in precipitation except for March, September and November which have shown declines. Models project that all months will become somewhat wetter (except for drier July and August), but the additional precipitation may not make up for the increases in temperature. The number of months classified as in severe drought declined slightly between 1961-1990 and 1986-2015.Â  However, between warming levels of 1.5Â°C and 2Â°C (global, relative to pre-industrial) the number of months in severe drought is projected to nearly double.Â    Biodiversity adaptation options will largely allow for business-as-usual conservation taking into account changes in extreme events (heat and severe drought). Typical resilience measures such as removing other stressors will likely be critical, especially at warming levels above 2.0Â°C warming.Â  At higher warming levels, increasingly complex adaptation measures will be required.  With the projected impacts of climate change on Wood Buffalo National Park (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11658152) there will be increasing need for additional breeding areas for the endangered Whooping Crane.Â  Necedah National Wildlife Refuge has been one of the primary areas for reintroduction of this species.Â  While there have been some successes, there have also been setbacks owing to black flies.Â  Projections show that Necedah remains a refugia for birds and, from a climate point of view, is important to try and retain as a breeding area for this endangered species.Â  While the Wallace Initiative does not have models (there are no occurrence data in GBIF) for the key black fly species impacting Whooping Cranes, fly species richness overall is projected to decline. The projected impacts on Wood Buffalo National Park suggest that captive breeding and reintroduction efforts need to be expanded and the number of reintroduction areas increased, taking into account the projected impacts of climate change.

As such, views of organismal distribution and the ecosystems they make up may be incorrect, undermining countless ecological and evolutionary studies. Using 742 million records of 374 900 species, we explore the global patterns and impacts of biases related to taxonomy, accessibility, ecotype and data type across terrestrial and marine systems. Pervasive sampling and observation biases exist across animals, with only 6.74% of the globe sampled, and disproportionately poor tropical sampling. High elevations and deep seas are particularly unknown. Over 50% of records in most groups account for under 2% of species and citizen-science only exacerbates biases. Additional data will be needed to overcome many of these biases, but we must increasingly value data publication to bridge this gap and better represent species' distributions from more distant and inaccessible areas, and provide the necessary basis for conservation and management.

One of the uses of the Red List is to evaluate and monitor the state of biodiversity and a possible approach for this purpose is the Red List Index (RLI). For many taxa, mainly hyperdiverse groups, it is not possible within available resources to assess all known species. In such cases, a random sample of species might be selected for assessment and the results derived from it extrapolated for the entire group - the Sampled Red List Index (SRLI). The current contribution is the third in four papers that will constitute the baseline of a future spider SRLI encompassing 200 species distributed across the world. New information: A sample of 200 species of spiders were randomly selected from the World Spider Catalogue, an updated global database containing all recognized species names for the group. The 200 selected species where divided taxonomically at the family level, and the familes were ordered alphabetically. In this publication, we present the conservation profiles of 58 species belonging to the famillies alphabetically arranged between Oecobiidae and Salticidae, which encompassed Oecobiidae, Oonopidae, Orsolobidae, Oxyopidae, Palpimanidae, Philodromidae, Pholcidae, Pisauridae, Prodidomidae and Salticidae.

Species delimitation of the North American orchard-spider Leucauge venusta (Walckenaer, 1841) (Araneae, Tetragnathidae)	JesÃºs A.

This species has a broad geographic distribution extending across tropical and temperate regions of the Americas from Canada to Brazil. Guided by a preliminary observation of the barcode gap between sequences from specimens of L. venusta collected in Florida and other North American localities, we collected across a transect through southeastern states of the USA to investigate the observed genetic divide. The dataset, complemented with additional samples from Mexico, and Brazil was analyzed for species delimitation using STACEY and bGMYC based on sequences from one nuclear (ITS2) and one mitochondrial marker (COI). The analyses clearly separate USA samples in two deeply divergent and geographically structured groups (north-south) which we interpret as two different species. We generated ecological niche models for these two groups rejecting a niche equivalence hypothesis for these lineages. Taxonomic changes are proposed based on these findings, Leucauge venusta is restricted to denote the northern clade, and its known distribution restricted to the USA. Leucauge argyrobapta (White, 1841) is removed from synonymy to denote the populations in Florida, Mexico and Brazil. Although the delimitation analyses suggest each of these geographic clusters within the L. argyrobapta samples represent different species, more specimens from Central and South America are needed to properly test the cohesion of L. argyrobapta populations.

The araneid spider Cyrtophora citricola is widely distributed in Europe, Asia, and Africa; however, in the last 26Â years, it has been reported in several countries across the Americas. To date, the geographic origin of the populations established in the Americas remains unclear, but considering the successful colonization after its recent arrival, assessing climatic similarities between the invaded and native geographic ranges could be useful to address this question. In this study, we used a combination of Species Distribution Models and Ordination Methods to assess the climatic match between the invaded region (the Americas) and two potential origins (southern Africa and the Mediterranean) aiming to determine the more likely origin for the populations established in the Americas. We found that the American populations of C. citricola occupy sites with climatic conditions more similar to those occupied by southern African populations, than to those occupied by the Mediterranean populations. Therefore, our results suggest a southern African rather than a Mediterranean origin for the populations established in America. In addition, our results also show that populations in America are spreading into sites that differ in climate conditions from those occupied by native populations. Further studies assessing intrinsic (e.g., physiological tolerances, plasticity, behavior, reproduction) and extrinsic (physical barriers, predator release) factors could provide further information to disentangle the mechanisms behind the geographic and climatic niche expansion of this species.

Species loss from land use of oil palm plantations in Thailand	Ukrit Jaroenkietkajorn|Shabbir H.

Thailand is in the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot, which contains high species richness. This study assesses the impacts of oil palm plantations on bird and insect species richness from land use in the five regions of Thailand by using the countryside Species-Area Relationship model. Data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and Thailandâ€™s Land Development Department (LDD) were used for species occurrence and land use data, respectively. This study focuses on the deforestation for oil palm because it poses the highest risk for wildlife compared to other habitats. The taxon affinity and regional characterization factors show the risk to wildlife (birds and insects) in the formerly natural habitat areas (i.e., deciduous, evergreen, and mangrove forests). The results show that the possibility of animal survival in former mangrove forests is higher than in other forests upon occupation, as demonstrated by the taxon affinity. Likewise, deforestation in the northern region causes the least species loss per area, as demonstrated by the lowest average regional characterization factor, because species densities are lowest. However, the impacts on species richness depend on the taxon and the combination of the region and the forest type. While the overall goal should be to minimize the expansion of oil palm, this study indicates in which forest type and Thai region land occupation causes less regional bird and insect species loss.

Species richness and phylogenetic diversity of different growth forms of angiosperms across a biodiversity hotspot in the horn of Africa	Yaâ€Dong Zhou|Biyansa Hirpo Boru|Shengâ€Wei Wang|Qingâ€Feng Wang	Journal of Systematics and Evolution	24.12.2019	2019-12-21T00:00:00.000Z	false	true	DOI	ETHIOPIA|ERITREA	ETHIOPIA|CHINA	Ethiopia and Eritrea|environmental variables|flora|phylogenetic diversity|woody and herbaceous	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1111/jse.12559	10.1111/jse.12559	8120eb1a-5bda-3086-8040-f5987720d364	Woody and herbaceous plants are differentially influenced by the environment, with nonrandom association with the evolutionary history of these taxa and their traits. In general, woody plants may have climateâ€dominated niches, whereas herbaceous plants may have edaphic and microhabitatâ€dominated niches. Here, we explored and mapped how the patterns of species richness, phylogenetic diversity and structures of total, woody and herbaceous plants vary across the geographical regions and with respect to 12 environmental variables across Ethiopia and Eritrea, in the horn of Africa. Our result showed that, both richness and phylogenetic diversity had almost the same tendency in total woody and herbaceous plants, in which they showed positive relationships with annual precipitation (AP), precipitation annual range (PAR) of climate, all the 3 variables of topography, total nitrogen (TN) and total extractable phosphorus (TEP) of soil, and negative relations with mean annual temperature (MAT). Compared with the total and herbaceous plants, the environmental variables explained greater variance both in SES.PD and NRI for woody plants. Our results highlight that, on the large spatial scales, the environmental filtering process has played a greater role in structuring species into local communities for woody plants than for herbaceous plants.

SPECIES: Supporting big-data-driven research	Raul Sierra-Alcocer|Christopher Stephens|Juan Barrios|Constantino GonzÃ¡lezâ€Salazar|Juan Carlos Salazar Carrillo|Pedro Romero MartÃ­nez	Biodiversity Information Science and Standards	21.06.2019	2019-06-21T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI		MEXICO	big data|correlation analysis|spatial data mining|species distributions|species occurrence records	CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS	https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.36095	10.3897/biss.3.36095	d2b0d45f-35f5-3fbc-a3ad-ce31705fe451	SPECIES (Stephens et al. 2019) is a tool to explore spatial correlations in biodiversity occurrence databases. The main idea behind the SPECIES project is that the geographical correlations between the distributions of taxa records have useful information. The problem, however, is that if we have thousands of species (Mexico's National System of Biodiversity Information has records of around 70,000 species) then we have millions of potential associations, and exploring them is far from easy. Our goal with SPECIES is to facilitate the discovery and application of meaningful relations hiding in our data.           The main variables in SPECIES are the geographical distributions of species occurrence records. Other types of variables, like the climatic variables from WorldClim (Hijmans et al. 2005), are explanatory data that serve for modeling. The system offers two modes of analysis. In one, the user defines a target species, and a selection of species and abiotic variables; then the system computes the spatial correlations between the target species and each of the other species and abiotic variables. The request from the user can be as small as comparing one species to another, or as large as comparing one species to all the species in the database. A user may wonder, for example, which species are usual neighbors of the jaguar, this mode could help answer this question. The second mode of analysis gives a network perspective, in it, the user defines two groups of taxa (and/or environmental variables), the output in this case is a correlation network where the weight of a link between two nodes represents the spatial correlation between the variables that the nodes represent. For example, one group of taxa could be hummingbirds (Trochilidae family) and the second flowers of the Lamiaceae family. This output would help the user analyze which pairs of hummingbird and flower are highly correlated in the database. SPECIES data architecture is optimized to support fast hypotheses prototyping and testing with the analysis of thousands of biotic and abiotic variables. It has a visualization web interface that presents descriptive results to the user at different levels of detail.           The methodology in SPECIES is relatively simple, it partitions the geographical space with a regular grid and treats a species occurrence distribution as a present/not present boolean variable over the cells. Given two species (or one species and one abiotic variable) it measures if the number of co-occurrences between the two is more (or less) than expected. If it is more than expected indicates a signal of a positive relation, whereas if it is less it would be evidence of disjoint distributions.           SPECIES provides an open web application programming interface (API) to request the computation of correlations and statistical dependencies between variables in the database.  Users can create applications that consume this 'statistical web service' or use it directly to further analyze the results in frameworks like R or Python. The project includes an interactive web application that does exactly that: requests analysis from the web service and lets the user experiment and visually explore the results. We believe this approach can be used on one side to augment the services provided from data repositories; and on the other side, facilitate the creation of specialized applications that are clients of these services. This scheme supports big-data-driven research for a wide range of backgrounds because end users do not need to have the technical know-how nor the infrastructure to handle large databases.           Currently, SPECIES hosts: all records from Mexico's National Biodiversity Information System (CONABIO 2018) and a subset of Global Biodiversity Information Facility data that covers the contiguous USA (GBIF.org 2018b) and Colombia (GBIF.org 2018a). It also includes discretizations of environmental variables from WorldClim, from the Environmental Rasters for Ecological Modeling project (Title and Bemmels 2018), from CliMond (Kriticos et al. 2012), and topographic variables (USGS EROS Center 1997b, USGS EROS Center 1997a). The long term plan, however, is to incrementally include more data, specially all data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. The code of the project is open source, and the repositories are available online (Front-end, Web Services Application Programming Interface, Database Building scripts).           This presentation is a demonstration of SPECIES' functionality and its overall design.

Multiple specimens are generated from a shared field collection event; generated specimens are then managed individually in separate repositories and independently augmented with research and management metadata which could be propagated to their duplicate peers. Establishing a data-derived network for metadata propagation will enable the reconciliation of closely related specimens which are currently dispersed, unconnected and managed independently. Following a data mining exercise applied to an aggregated dataset of 19,827,998 specimen records from 292 separate specimen repositories, 36% or 7,102,710 specimens are assessed to participate in duplication relationships, allowing the propagation of metadata among the participants in these relationships, totalling: 93,044 type citations, 1,121,865 georeferences, 1,097,168 images and 2,191,179 scientific name determinations. The results enable the creation of networks to identify which repositories could work in collaboration. Some classes of annotation (particularly those regarding scientific name determinations) represent units of scientific work: appropriate management of this data would allow the accumulation of scholarly credit to individual researchers: potential further work in this area is discussed.

Strong phylogenetic signals in global plant bioclimatic envelopes	Neil Brummitt|Christina A Cobbold|Claire Harris|Richard Reeve	Global Ecology and Biogeography	22.07.2022	2022-07-20T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	generic_DOIs_provided		UNITED_KINGDOM	biodiversity|climate change|global|phylogenetic niche conservatism|plants|traits	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13564	10.1111/geb.13564	d7194275-be46-398e-9a99-a4b0f2287084	Aim The environmental preferences of species are an important facet of their response to changing conditions, and these have long been thought to exhibit phylogenetic conservatism. However, these bioclimatic envelopes have not previously been imputed from climate records at the date and location of occurrence, and the strength of their phylogenetic signal has not been studied at a broad scale. Here, we combine records from global climate reconstructions with contemporaneous plant occurrences for all available terrestrial plant species and test for phylogenetic niche conservatism in plant climatic traits.  Location Global.  Time period 1901â€“2018.  Major taxa studied Terrestrial plants.  Methods We used >100 million plant records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to produce distributions of bioclimatic envelopes for >200,000 species, using a range of climate variables. We matched species observations to historical climate reconstructions from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) and compared this with WorldClim climate averages. We tested for phylogenetic signal in a supertree of plants using Pagel's Î». Finally, to investigate how well bioclimatic envelopes could be inferred for poorly known and rare species, we performed cross-validation by removing occurrence records for some common species to test how accurately their bioclimatic envelopes were estimated.  Results We found extremely strong phylogenetic signals (Î» >â€‰0.9 in some cases) for climate variables from both climate datasets, including temperature, soil temperature, solar radiation and precipitation. We were also able to impute missing bioclimatic envelopes for artificially removed species, having a correlation with observed data of .7.  Main conclusions We reconstructed plant climatic tolerances for >200,000 plant species historically recorded on GBIF using a technique that could be applied to any comparable biodiversity dataset. Although global information on most species is sparse, we explored methods for bias correction and data imputation, with positive results for both.

Subtropical high-montane forest climate refuges in Brazil	Guilherme Neto dos Santos|Ana Carolina da Silva|Pedro Higuchi	Scientia Agricola	11.04.2023	2023-04-07T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI	BRAZIL	BRAZIL	climate change scenarios|climate variables|cloud forests|subtropical Atlantic Forest	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-992x-2022-0044	10.1590/1678-992x-2022-0044	eb1fee9c-3b03-3a49-aa6f-062680cf3837	Climate change represents one of the greatest threats to global biodiversity. We investigate how climate change will affect the future potential distribution of tree species in subtropical high montane habitats in the Atlantic Forest and identify potential climate refuges for these species. The most frequent and exclusive species in this ecosystem were selected and geographic coordinates were compiled. The maximum entropy algorithm was used for climatic niche modeling. Two scenarios for 2061-2080 were considered for future predictions, one low impact (RCP 4.5) and one high impact (RCP 8.5). Isothermality, mean temperature in the driest quarter, mean temperature in the hottest quarter, rainfall in the driest month, and rainfall in the hottest quarter were the variables that best explained the climatic niche of the majority of species. The areas of potential species occurrence were reduced by 48.37 % (Â± 13.63 %) (RCP 4.5) and 62.49 % (Â± 21.87 %) (RCP 8.5) on average. The potential area of Crinodendron brasilense Reitz & L.B.Sm. decreased the most, by 82.11 % (RCP 4.5) and 90.06 % (RCP 8.5), respectively. High elevation areas in the south of Brazil were identified as priorities for conservation to ensure that climate refuges for high montane forest species are maintained in the future. Climate change events may significantly affect the species evaluated in this study.	CLIMATE_CHANGE	2023-04-13T11:31:50.606Z	0003822-180508205500799

Yet, most species remain unknown or unstudied, while others attract most of the public, scientific and government attention. Although known to be detrimental, this taxonomic bias continues to be pervasive in the scientific literature, but is still poorly studied and understood. Here, we used 626 million occurrences from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), the biggest biodiversity data portal, to characterize the taxonomic bias in biodiversity data. We also investigated how societal preferences and taxonomic research relate to biodiversity data gathering. For each species belonging to 24 taxonomic classes, we used the number of publications from Web of Science and the number of web pages from Bing searches to approximate research activity and societal preferences. Our results show that societal preferences, rather than research activity, strongly correlate with taxonomic bias, which lead us to assert that scientists should advertise less charismatic species and develop societal initiatives (e.g. citizen science) that specifically target neglected organisms. Ensuring that biodiversity is representatively sampled while this is still possible is an urgent prerequisite for achieving efficient conservation plans and a global understanding of our surrounding environment.

Temperature change in subtropical southeastern Africa during the past 790,000 yr	Manuel Chevalier|Brian M. Chase|Lynne J. Quick|Lydie M. Dupont|Thomas C. Johnson	Geology	07.09.2020	2020-09-04T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI		GERMANY|SWITZERLAND|UNITED_STATES|FRANCE|SOUTH_AFRICA		JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1130/G47841.1	10.1130/g47841.1	62dc26c7-fbca-392d-8d77-c7844eb5fc40	Across the glacial-interglacial cycles of the late Pleistocene (~700 k.y.), temperature variability at low latitudes is often considered to have been negligible compared to changes in precipitation. However, a paucity of quantified temperature records makes this difficult to reliably assess. In this study, we used the Bayesian method CREST (Climate REconstruction SofTware) to produce a 790,000 yr quantified temperature reconstruction from a marine pollen record from southeast Africa. The results reveal a strong similarity between temperature variability in subtropical Africa and global ice volume and CO2 concentrations, indicating that temperature in the region was not controlled by local insolation, but followed global trends at these time scales, with an amplitude of ~4 Â°C between glacial minima and interglacial maxima. The data also enabled us to make an assessment of the impact of temperature change on pollen diversity, with results showing there is no link between glacial-age temperatures/CO2 and a loss of diversity in this record.

These models relate species occurrences with the environmental conditions found at these sites. Climatic variables are the most commonly used environmental data and are usually included in SDMs as averages of a reference period (30â€“50 years). In this study, we analyse the impact of including interâ€annual climatic variability on the estimation of species niches and predicted distributions when assessing plant demographic response to extreme climatic episodes.  Location: Mediterranean basin, SE Iberian Peninsula.  Methods: We first characterized species niches with interâ€annual and average climate in the same environmental space. We then compare the respective capacities of climatic suitability obtained from averaged climateâ€based and from interâ€annual variabilityâ€based niches to explain population demographic responses to extreme drought. Furthermore, we assessed the relative increase in niche size when including climatic variability for a set of Mediterranean species exhibiting a wide range of distribution areas.  Results: We found that climatic suitability obtained from interâ€annual variabilityâ€based niches showed higher explanatory capacity than average climateâ€based suitability, especially for populations living in climatically marginal conditions, although both niches quantifications significantly explained species demographic responses. In addition, species with restricted distribution ranges increased relatively more their niche space when considering climatic variability, probably because in widely distributed species spatial variability compensates for temporal variability.  Main conclusions The common use of climatic averages when characterizing species niches could lead to underestimations of species distribution and misunderstanding of demographic behaviour, with implications for conservation plans derived from SDMs, for example, overestimations of species extinction risk under climate change, or underestimations of alien species invasionâ€™ risk. We highlight that including climatic variability in niche modelling can be particularly important when dealing with species with restricted distribution and populations at the margin of their species niche.

The biased distribution of existing information on biodiversity hinders its use in conservation, and we need an integrative approach to act urgently	Emilio GarcÃ­a-RosellÃ³|Jacinto GonzÃ¡lez-Dacosta|Jorge M. Lobo	Biological Conservation	16.05.2023	2023-07-31T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	DOI		SPAIN	Biodiversity data|Climatic representativeness|Completeness|Terrestrial classes|Well-surveyed cells	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110118	10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110118	645b7a1e-27dd-3dd0-ab4a-5dd5a0e7a3c1	The data collected by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), some 2.2 billion records, is arguably the largest international initiative to digitize and share primary biodiversity data. In this study, we examine the global distribution of completeness values discriminating those 30-minute cells that are likely to have reliable inventories for the most important terrestrial classes of Animalia and Plantae. The aim of this exploration is not only to show the biases and deficiencies in the biodiversity information collected so far, but also to estimate the climatic variability represented by these data in order to known their representativeness for conservation purposes. The results obtained show that information on biodiversity distribution is taxonomically and geographically biased towards regions and groups with more taxonomic resources and a longer naturalistic tradition. The amount of distributional data is very uneven across the different biological groups, and unrelated to the diversity they possess. The global patterns of completeness seem to be conditioned by the historical taxonomic, faunistic and floristic interest received by the different classes of organisms. In addition, well-surveyed global areas account for barely 1Â % of global climate variability, leaving uncovered a large set of climatic conditions. All these results prevent us from relying exclusively on the available primary information on the distribution of organisms to identify biodiversity patterns and/or design conservation proposals. Given that the biodiversity crisis demands urgent action, biases and gaps in primary biodiversity information cannot be an excuse and conservation decisions must be made considering a broad set of criteria based on existing scientifically proven knowledge and techniques capable of providing the necessary answers.

The biogeography of ecoregions: Descriptive power across regions and taxa	Jeffrey R. Smith|J. Nicholas Hendershot|Nicole Nova|Gretchen C.

Recent dataâ€intensive analysis has shown that, while ecoregions do delineate biotic communities, how distinct they are from one another varies considerably across regions and taxa. Given their central importance to global models of the earth system and to the development of conservation plans, it is key to understand in what regions, and for which taxa, ecoregion classification schemes best describe the underlying variability in biological communities. Location: Global. Taxa: Plants, animals, fungi. Methods: In this paper, we integrate ecoregion maps with data on spatially continuous changes in environmental conditions, biodiversity and species traits to quantify the descriptive power of ecoregions around the globe. Capitalizing on the troves of newly available global biodiversity data, we model the abiotic and biotic factors that describe how distinct ecoregions are from one another. Results: From an abiotic perspective, we report compelling evidence that, first, ecoregions are more distinct in tropical zones with higher temperatures, less temperature seasonality and greater rainfall seasonality. Second, we also find that ecoregions are more distinct in regions with steeper slopes. From a biotic perspective, we find that ecoregions tend to be more distinct for reptiles and amphibians than they are for mammals or birds. Likewise, ecoregions tend to be more distinct for smallerâ€bodied species and, to a lesser extent, species at lower trophic levels. Main conclusions While ecoregionâ€based conservation planning can provide a crucial tool for developing holistic conservation interventions, we show here that the ability to capture and describe communities is not uniform across regions or taxa. In particular, ecoregions tend to best describe communities of smallâ€bodied species, less vagile and tropical taxa that are typically underrepresented in the scientific literature. While ecoregion classification schemes will continue to provide invaluable conservation guidance, we must think critically about when an ecoregional approach is best suited to informing management.

Nonetheless, at global scales, we do not know what fraction of biodiversity consists of rare species. Here, we present the largest compilation of global plant diversity to quantify the fraction of Earthâ€™s plant biodiversity that are rare. A large fraction, ~36.5% of Earthâ€™s ~435,000 plant species, are exceedingly rare. Sampling biases and prominent models, such as neutral theory and the k-niche model, cannot account for the observed prevalence of rarity. Our results indicate that (i) climatically more stable regions have harbored rare species and hence a large fraction of Earthâ€™s plant species via reduced extinction risk but that (ii) climate change and human land use are now disproportionately impacting rare species. Estimates of global species abundance distributions have important implications for risk assessments and conservation planning in this era of rapid global change.

However, ENMs depend on speciesâ€environment equilibrium, which may be absent for actively expanding species. We present a novel framework to estimate whether species have reached environmental equilibrium in their native and alien ranges. The method is based on the estimation of niche breadth with the accumulation of species occurrences. An asymptote will indicate exhaustive knowledge of the realised niches. We demonstrate the CNA framework for 26 species of mammals, amphibians, and birds. Possible outcomes of the framework include: (1) There is enough data to quantify the native and alien realised niches, allowing us to calculate niche expansion between the native and alien ranges, also indicating that ENMs can be reliably projected to new environmental conditions. (2) The data in the native range is not adequate but an asymptote is reached in the alien realised niche, indicating low confidence in our ability to evaluate niche expansion in the alien range but high confidence in model projections to new environmental conditions within the alien range. (3) There is enough data to quantify the native realised niche, but not enough knowledge about the alien realised niche, hindering the reliability of projections beyond sampled conditions. (4) Both the native and alien ranges do not reach an asymptote, and thus few robust conclusions about the speciesâ€™ niche or future projections can be made. Our framework can be used to detect speciesâ€™ environmental equilibrium in both the native and alien ranges, to quantify changes in the realised niche during the invasion processes, and to estimate the likely accuracy of model projections to new environmental conditions.

However, tropical ecosystems are also subject to pervasive and interacting stressors, such as deforestation, overfishing and climate change, and they are set within a socio-economic context that includes growing pressure from an increasingly globalized world, larger and more affluent tropical populations, and weak governance and response capacities. Concerted local, national and international actions are urgently required to prevent a collapse of tropical biodiversity.	CLIMATE_CHANGE	2020-11-24T15:51:03.830Z	0011803-171219132708484
The ghosts of forests past and future: deforestation and botanical sampling in the Brazilian Amazon	J. Stropp|B. Umbelino|R. A. Correia|J. V. Campos-Silva|R. J. Ladle|A. C. M.

When undocumented areas become deforested, in addition to losing the fauna and flora, we lose the opportunity to know which unique species had occupied a habitat. Here we quantify such knowledge loss by calculating how much of the Brazilian Amazon has been deforested and will likely be deforested until 2050 without having its tree flora sufficiently documented. To this end, we analysed 399 147 digital specimens of nearly 6000 tree species in relation to official deforestation statistics and future deforestation scenarios. We find that by 2017, 30% of all the localities where tree specimens had been collected were mostly deforested. Some 300 000â€‰km2 (12%; 485 25â€‰Ã—â€‰25â€‰km grid cells) of the Brazilian Amazon had been deforested by 2017, without having a single tree specimen recorded. An additional 250 000â€“900 000â€‰km2 of severely underâ€collected rainforest will likely become deforested by 2050. If future tree sampling is to cover this area, sampling effort has to increase twoâ€ to sixâ€fold. Nearly 255 000â€‰km2 or 7% of rainforest in the Brazilian Amazon is easily accessible but does yet but remain underâ€collected. Our study highlights how progressing deforestation increases the risk of losing undocumented species of a hyperâ€diverse tree flora.

Location: Global terrestrial. Time Period: Data sources range from 1757â€“2017; data assembled April 2017. Taxon: Spiders (Araneae). Methods: Using metadata on the countries of origin for 98% of all described spider species, this study applies PostGIS queries to calculate the number of species, and the species richness per land area, along tenâ€degree latitudinal bands. Results: More spider species are known in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere. Although the global latitudinal diversity gradient pattern in species richness per area is, indeed, pearâ€shaped, this pattern only applies to Old World longitudes and only if it is assumed that the speciesâ€area relationship is linear. Without this assumption, the latitudinal gradient matches the classic parabolic shape. Main conclusions: Using data from the World Spider Catalog, the global latitudinal diversity gradient pattern for spiders, in terms of species per unit area and assuming a power function for the speciesâ€area relationship, is eggâ€shaped, or parabolic, rather than pearâ€shaped as previously claimed.

An example is the draft law (DL) 527/2016, which aimed to reduce approximately 70% of the Devonian Escarpment Environmental Protection Area (DEEPA), a large PA in southern Brazil, hosts two biodiversity hotspot biomes. This study shows the possible downsizing damages to biodiversity and landscape by quantifying the size and connectivity of the vegetation remnants in the surrounding landscape concerning the degree of threat to the species that occur in both the Atlantic Forest and Brazilian Savanna domains. The DEEPA downsizing can affect natural savanna and Atlantic Forest vegetation area proposed by DL 527/2016 would fail in protecting 383 (56.82%) of the threatened species. Only three species evaluated as critically endangered, 13 classified as endangered, and 13 classified as vulnerable would be preserved; the reduction would also negatively affect essential ecosystem services and the quality of life in human populations. Furthermore, man-made fragmentation and habitat loss would jeopardize several biological and ecological aspects fundamental to biomes' maintenance and ecosystem services. In addition to reducing this environmental protection area, it would cut taxes from the current PA and could affect its surrounding municipalities in southern Brazil.

They are, however, no longer gathered as they used to be and the mass-production of observation-based occurrences is overthrowing the collection of specimen-based occurrences. Although this change in practice is a major upheaval with significant consequences in the study of biodiversity, it remains understudied and has not attracted yet the attention it deserves. Analyzing 536 million occurrences from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) mediated data, we show that this spectacular change affects the 24 eukaryote taxonomic classes we targeted: from 1970 to 2016 the proportion of occurrences marked as traceable to tangible material (i.e. specimen-based occurrences) fell from 68 to 18%; moreover, most of those specimen based-occurrences cannot be readily traced back to a specimen because the necessary information is missing. Ethical, practical or legal reasons responsible for this shift are known, and this situation appears unlikely to be reversed. Still, we urge scholars to acknowledge this dramatic change, embrace it and actively deal with it. Specifically, we emphasize why specimen-based occurrences must be gathered, as a warrant to allow both repeating evolutionary studies and conducting rich and diverse investigations. When impossible to secure, voucher specimens must be replaced with observation-based occurrences combined with ancillary data (e.g. pictures, recordings, samples, DNA sequences). Ancillary data are instrumental for the usefulness of biodiversity occurrences and we show that, despite improving technologies to collate them, they remain rarely shared. The consequences of such a change are not yet clear but we advocate collecting material evidence or ancillary data to ensure that primary biodiversity data collected lately do not partly become obsolete when doubtful.

The phylogeny of insects in the dataâ€driven era	Douglas Chesters	Systematic Entomology	24.12.2019	2019-12-19T00:00:00.000Z	false	true	DOI		CHINA		JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1111/syen.12414	10.1111/syen.12414	c0944e62-a758-38a9-95d2-d0f3fd25e732	Maturation of omics and DNA barcode programs along with advances in sequence analysis tools and phyloinformatics protocols are enabling the realization of comprehensive and robust phylogenies of even the most diverse lineages. Several lineages in insects have undergone hyperâ€radiations, and thus a unified picture of their evolution is ultimately required for understanding the process of diversification. In this study I further develop informatics protocols for de novo phylogenetic construction, and present the most speciesâ€comprehensive insect phylogeny to date, constructed hierarchically using c. 440 transcriptomes, 1490 mitogenomes, DNA barcodes for 69â€‰000 species, and several additional speciesâ€rich markers. Even with this expanded transcriptome backbone, support is still insufficient for some historically problematic nodes, particularly in Polyneoptera and Paraneoptera. Low support (measured by internode certainty) was observed for the node separating Dictyoptera from its sister polyneopeterans; configuration of the Paraneoptera was not resolved; the recently proposed Hymenoptera grouping Eusymphyta received high support, while Parasitoida did not; and Orthorrhapha (Diptera) was not recovered. Sampling is uneven across the insects, and while highly sequenced lineages (e.g. Lepidoptera) boast greater information content, this accompanies computational burdens. The protocol and resulting tree represent an advance in the analytic and phylogenetic framework, for an objectively and consistently determined speciesâ€comprehensive phylogeny.

However, the diversity of micro-organisms constitutes the majority of all life forms on Earth. Here, we ask if the patterns of richness inferred for macro-organisms are similar for micro-organisms. For this, we barcoded samples of soil, litter and insects from four localities on a west-to-east transect across Amazonia. We quantified richness as Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) in those samples using three molecular markers. We then compared OTU richness with species richness of two relatively well-studied organism groups in Amazonia: trees and birds. We find that OTU richness shows a declining west-to-east diversity gradient that is in agreement with the species richness patterns documented here and previously for birds and trees. These results suggest that most taxonomic groups respond to the same overall diversity gradients at large spatial scales. However, our results show a different pattern of richness in relation to habitat types, suggesting that the idiosyncrasies of each taxonomic group and peculiarities of the local environment frequently override large-scale diversity gradients. Our findings caution against using the diversity distribution of one taxonomic group as an indication of patterns of richness across all groups.

The potential of ecoregional range maps for boosting taxonomic coverage in ecology and conservation	Stefan Pinkert|Yanina V.

Many species without ExpRMs also have too few occurrence records for reliable application of species distribution models (SDMs). Here we evaluate the performance of commonly used range surrogates and recommend tools that can help fill this significant knowledge gap across a wide range of understudied taxa. Specifically, we explore an alternative range surrogate (ecoregional range maps; EcoRMs), assess its performance versus traditional approaches for 624 North American butterfly species, and outline its use alone and as part of SDMs. As an alternative range estimate, we use terrestrial ecoregions that represent a regionalization of biogeographical zones and we suggest geographical filters and simplifications that improve their performance. We show that consistently across different spatial scales and both in comparison with ExpRMs and SDMs, EcoRMs have an exceptionally high sensitivity and generally a high mean performance. Particularly for species with fewer than 100 occurrence records, EcoRMs outperform other range surrogates. The congruence of species richness patterns was also similar for all approaches. The use of EcoRMs as substitute for dataâ€poor species without ExpRMs will strongly boost taxonomic coverage of range maps. Additionally, integrating EcoRMs as domains/masks/offsets into SDMs promises significant improvements to model accuracy. For butterflies alone, EcoRMs would thereby provide new range information for 17% and improve basic range information for 43% of all approximately nineteen thousand species. Other technical advantages of generating EcoRMs may also help to overcome issues of the availability, updateability, reproducibility, and circularity of ExpRMs, SDMs and minimum convex hulls (MCVs). In summary, ecoregionâ€based range maps offer a versatile tool for ecology and conservation of terrestrial taxa and the application of the EcoRM approach may prove similarly useful for freshwater and marine ecoregions.

The projected effect on insects, vertebrates, and plants of limiting global warming to 1.5Â°C rather than 2Â°C	R. Warren|J. Price|E. Graham|N. Forstenhaeusler|J.

With current pledges, corresponding to ~3.2Â°C warming, climatically determined geographic range losses of >50% are projected in ~49% of insects, 44% of plants, and 26% of vertebrates. At 2Â°C, this falls to 18% of insects, 16% of plants, and 8% of vertebrates and at 1.5Â°C, to 6% of insects, 8% of plants, and 4% of vertebrates. When warming is limited to 1.5Â°C as compared with 2Â°C, numbers of species projected to lose >50% of their range are reduced by ~66% in insects and by ~50% in plants and vertebrates.

Of these species, five are endemic to the Andean region of the country. Despite representing the group of mammals with the highest rate of endemic species, the knowledge currently available on aspects such as natural history, distribution, and ecology is limited. This work assesses the current state of knowledge of the shrews of Colombia, discusses taxonomic issues, risks and threats related to conservation, and identifies research needs and priorities. We compile the information on shrews of Colombia available in the literature and databases. We include two of the known species of the country and one to be determined within a phylogenetic context. In general, the knowledge of the shrews of Colombia reveals the lack of ecological and genetic studies. There are unsolved taxonomic questions about the presence of certain species in the different mountain ranges of the country. There is an urgent need to generate molecular information to clarify the richness of the genus in Colombia which, according to our observations, has been underestimated. The knowledge about the shrews of Colombia is still scarce, even when some species were first described more than a hundred years ago. The need to conduct systematic studies and comprehensive morphological descriptions to clarify the richness of the shrews of Colombia is highlighted.

Here we show that 67,384 of 89,151 insect species assessed globally (76%) do not meet minimum target levels of PA coverage. Nearly 1,900 species from 225 families do not overlap with PAs at all. Species with low PA coverage predominantly occur in North America, Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Australasia. The Post 2020 Global Biodiversity Framework5 provides a unique opportunity for nations to guide new PA designations that specifically take account of the needs of insects.

The ocean is also a huge part of the solution to the challenges we face, from ocean-derived food and materials to energy.   However, ensuring that we protect the ocean as we scale up these solutions requires closing crucial knowledge gaps, and that begins with better data â€” because we cannot manage what we cannot measure.   This report assesses the private sector contributions to ocean biodiversity data.   The assessment was conducted on two of the largest global biodiversity repositoriesâ€”OBIS (Ocean Biodiversity Information System) and GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) and sheds light on the fragmented nature of private sector contributions.

Location: The tropics. Time period: The Cenozoic. Major taxa studied: The plant subfamily Bombacoideae (Malvaceae). Methods: We inferred ancestral biomes based on a fossilâ€dated molecular phylogeny of 103 species (59% of the clade) and recorded the number of transitions among biomes using biogeographical stochastic mapping based on the dispersalâ€extinctionâ€cladogenesis model. We then estimated diversification rates using stateâ€specific speciation and extinction rate (SSE) methods. Furthermore, we tested the sensitivity of the results to model choice, phylogenetic uncertainty, measurement error and biome definition. Results: We found numerous transitions from evergreen rain forest to seasonally dry biomes, and fewer in the opposite direction. These results were robust to methodological choices. Biome type did not influence diversification rates, although this result was subject to uncertainty, especially related to model choice and biome definition. Main conclusions: Our results contradict the idea of evolutionary biome conservatism in Bombacoideae, and support previous findings that evergreen rain forests serve as a source for the flora of seasonally dry biomes. The impact of biome classification and biome definition on the results suggest caution when using a biome concept for biogeographical reconstruction and diversification rate analysis.

Trapped indoors? Long-distance dispersal in mygalomorph spiders and its effect on species ranges	Bruno A.

Here, we attempted to compile all the information available on their long-distance dispersal mechanisms from observations that are often spread throughout the taxonomic literature. Mygalomorphs can disperse terrestrially, and in some tarantulas, for example, spiderlings walk together in single files away from their maternal burrow, a mechanism limited in distance covered. Conversely, at least eight species disperse aerially, via dropping on drag lines from elevated positions and being passively blown off (â€˜suspended ballooningâ€™). The first record of this behaviour is 135 years old, but we still know very little about it. Phylogeographic studies suggest several occurrences of transcontinental dispersal in the evolutionary history of mygalomorphs, but these might result from contingent rafting events, rather than regular dispersal mechanisms. We use occurrence data to show that suspended ballooning increases the species ranges in Australian mygalomorph families where this behaviour has been recorded. We also identified Anamidae, Idiopidae, and especially Atracidae, as families that might employ suspended ballooning or another efficient but undiscovered dispersal mechanism. Finally, we suggest that molecular studies with mitochondrial genes will help disentangle behavioural limitations of dispersal from ecological or physical ones.

Trends in habitat suitability and conservation status of aquatic spiders in Europe	Filippo Milano|Pedro Cardoso|Stefano Mammola|Helen Smith|Marco Isaia	Biological Conservation	24.10.2022	2022-11-30T00:00:00.000Z	false	true	generic_DOIs_provided		UNITED_KINGDOM|ITALY|FINLAND	Climate change|Extinction risk|IUCN|Invertebrate conservation|Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)|Wetlands	JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109767	10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109767	e3ac8094-1be3-35e9-ad25-fe6cfcd386a0	Wetlands, one of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world, are increasingly subjected to area loss and degradation due to land-use and climate changes. These factors impact their unique biodiversity, including numerous invertebrates that depend on them. Here we investigated the current and future habitat suitability of the aquatic spiders Argyroneta aquatica and Dolomedes plantarius. We evaluated future trends in their geographic range, aiming at assessing their extinction risk according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria, at both global and regional levels. We investigated present and future distribution ranges using species distribution models for two integrated emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5) and combining three general circulation models. These were combined with knowledge on species' dispersal limitation to account for the possibility that these species will not be able to move beyond the current range in the next decades. We found a significant future northern shift in the geographic range and a global reduction in habitat suitability for both species, corresponding to a loss of 28.9Â % for A. aquatica and 38.1Â % for D. plantarius in the next 10Â years. The application of the IUCN criteria qualifies A. aquatica as Near Threatened and D. plantarius as Vulnerable. Regional assessments provided similar patterns of range reductions and population vulnerability across all European regions, particularly for Central-Eastern and Western Europe. Conversely, Northern Europe is expected to become a climatic refugium for both species. This work goes beyond the available studies on the conservation of these species by taking account their dispersal abilities in quantifying future trends in their habitat suitability using the most up to date knowledge. Conservation strategies should be directed towards limiting the impact of climatic and non-climatic stressors on wetlands, and towards implementing management plans and restoration programmes to increase habitat suitability and connectivity among wetland patches.

Tropical and Mediterranean biodiversity is disproportionately sensitive to land-use and climate change	Tim Newbold|Philippa Oppenheimer|Adrienne Etard|Jessica J.

Global models help us to understand the consequences of environmental changes for biodiversity, but tend to neglect important geographical variation in the sensitivity of biodiversity to these changes. Here we test whether biodiversity responses to climate change and land-use change differ among biomes (geographical units that have marked differences in environment and species composition). We find the strongest negative responses to both pressures in tropical biomes and in the Mediterranean. A further analysis points towards similar underlying drivers for the sensitivity to each pressure: we find both greater reductions in species richness in the types of land use most disturbed by humans and more negative predicted responses to climate change in areas of lower climatic seasonality, and in areas where a greater proportion of species are near their upper temperature limit. Within the land most modified by humans, reductions in biodiversity were particularly large in regions where humans have come to dominate the land more recently. Our results will help to improve predictions of how biodiversity is likely to change with ongoing climatic and land-use changes, pointing toward particularly large declines in the tropics where much future agricultural expansion is expected to occur. This finding could help to inform the development of the post-2020 biodiversity framework, by highlighting the under-studied regions where biodiversity losses are likely to be greatest.

To study the effect of the Tropic in the distribution of species, and to explore how community composition changes southwards, we analyze patterns of beta-diversity across the Neotropical region. Using locality data from GBIF, we show a latitudinal gradient in the degree of species turnover, but only in the cis-Andean region. Although previous taxon-centric analyses detected breakpoints in the components of beta-diversity at the tropical-subtropical transition, we were unable to identify them at large scale and level of data aggregation studied here: there was no single latitude at which a change in the behavior of beta-diversity could be detected. Although the replacement of species is the main component responsible for the changes in the composition of the communities in South America, the Tropic of Capricorn does not seem to represent a threshold in community turnover at this large scale.

Precise knowledge of where the specimens were collected is paramount to rigorous ecological studies, especially in the field of species distribution modelling. Here, we present a first comprehensive analysis of georeferencing quality for all preserved specimen records served by GBIF, and illustrate the impact that coordinate uncertainty may have on predicted potential distributions. We used all GBIF preserved specimen records to analyse the availability of coordinates and associated spatial uncertainty across geography, spatial resolution, taxonomy, publishing institutions and collection time. We used three plant species across their native ranges in different parts of the world to show the impact of uncertainty on predicted potential distributions. We found that 38% of the 180+ million records provide coordinates only and 18% coordinates and uncertainty. Georeferencing quality is determined more by country of collection and publishing than by taxonomic group. Distinct georeferencing practices are more determinant than implicit characteristics and georeferencing difficulty of specimens. Availability and quality of records contrasts across world regions. Uncertainty values are not normally distributed but peak at very distinct values, which can be traced back to specific regions of the world. Uncertainty leads to a wide spectrum of range sizes when modelling species distributions, potentially affecting conclusions in biogeographical and climate change studies. In summary, the digitised fraction of the world's NHCs are far from optimal in terms of georeferencing and quality mainly depends on where the collections are hosted. A collective effort between communities around NHC institutions, ecological research and data infrastructure is needed to bring the data on a par with its importance and relevance for ecological research.

Here, we use more than one billion observations from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to assess global species abundance distributions (gSADs) of 39 taxonomic classes of eukaryotic organisms from 1900 to 2019. We show that, as sampling effort increases through time, the shape of the gSAD is unveiled; that is, the shape of the sampled gSAD changes, revealing the underlying gSAD. The fraction of species unveiled for each class decreases with the total number of species in that class and increases with the number of individuals sampled, with some groups, such as birds, being fully unveiled. The best statistical fit for almost all classes was the Poisson log-normal distribution. This strong evidence for a universal pattern of gSADs across classes suggests that there may be general ecological or evolutionary mechanisms governing the commonness and rarity of life on Earth. Using occurrence records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the authors show that the global species abundance distribution of 39 taxonomic classes of eukaryotes is best fit by a Poisson log-normal distribution.

WEGE: A NEW METRIC FOR RANKING LOCATIONS FOR BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION	Harith Farooq|Josue Anderson|Francesco Belluardo|Cristovao Nanvonamuquitxo|Dominic Bennett|Justin Moat|Amadeu Soares|Soren Faurby|Alexandre Antonelli	bioRxiv	19.01.2020	2020-01-18T00:00:00.000Z	false	false	DOI	MOZAMBIQUE	MOZAMBIQUE|UNITED_KINGDOM|PORTUGAL|SWEDEN	Africa|EDGE|KBAs|Key Biodiversity Area|Mozambique|policy-making|prioritization	WORKING_PAPER	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.17.910299	10.1101/2020.01.17.910299	41472bbe-aca2-318e-a061-f1168459e5af	In order to implement effective conservation policies, it is crucial to know how biodiversity is distributed and one of the most widely used systems is the Key Biodiversity Areas (hereafter KBA) criteria, developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Here we develop a tool to rank Key Biodiversity Areas in a continuous scale to allow the ranking between KBAs and test this tool on a simulated dataset of 10 000 scenarios of species compositions of reptiles and mammals in eight locations in Mozambique.LocationMozambique, AfricaMethodsWe compare the KBA criteria with four priorisation metrics (weighted endemism, extinction risk, evolutionary distinctiveness and EDGE score) to rank the biodiversity importance of eight sites with a randomly generated species composition of reptiles and mammals in Mozambique.ResultsWe find that none of these metrics is able to provide a suitable ranking of the sites surveyed that would ultimately allow prioritization. We therefore develop and validate the â€œWEGE indexâ€ (Weighted Endemism including Global Endangerment index), which is an adaptation of the EDGE score (Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered) and allows the ranking of sites according to the KBA criteria but on a continuous scale.Main conclusionsFor our study system, the WEGE index scores areas that trigger KBA status higher and is able to rank their importance in terms of biodiversity by using the range and threat status of species present at the site. Prioritization may be crucial for policy making and real-life conservation, allowing the choice between otherwise equally qualified sites according to the KBA categories. WEGE is intended to support a transparent decision-making process in conservation.

What we (don't) know about global plant diversity	William K. Cornwell|William D. Pearse|Rhiannon L. Dalrymple|Amy E.

While large genetic, geographic and trait databases are available, these are neither complete nor random samples of the globe. Gaps and biases in these databases reduce our inferential and predictive power, and this incompleteness is even more worrisome because we are ignorant of both its kind and magnitude. We performed a comprehensive examination of the taxonomic and spatial sampling in the most complete current databases for plant genes, locations, and functional traits. To do this, we downloaded data from The Plant List (taxonomy), the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (locations), TRY (traits) and GenBank (genes). Only 17.7% of the world's described and accepted land plant species feature in all three databases, meaning that more than 82% of known plant biodiversity lacks representation in at least one database. Species coverage is highest for location data and lowest for genetic data. Bryophytes and orchids stand out taxonomically and the equatorial region stands out spatially as poorly represented in all databases. We have highlighted a number of clades and regions about which we know little functionally, spatially and genetically, on which we should set research targets. The scientific community should recognize and reward the significant value, both for biodiversity science and conservation, of filling in these gaps in our knowledge of the plant tree of life.

Which mammals can be identified from camera traps and crowdsourced photographs?

Some species are easily recognized in these pictures, others are impossible to distinguish. Here we quantify the extent to which 335 terrestrial nonvolant North American mammals can be identified in typical photographs, with and without considering species range maps. We evaluated all pairwise comparisons of species and judged, based on professional opinion, whether they are visually distinguishable in typical pictures from camera traps or the iNaturalist crowdsourced platform on a 4-point scale: (1) always, (2) usually, (3) rarely, or (4) never. Most (96.5%) of the 55,944 pairwise comparisons were ranked as always or usually distinguishable in a photograph, leaving exactly 2,000 pairs of species that can rarely or never be distinguished from typical pictures, primarily within clades such as shrews and small-bodied rodents. Accounting for a species geographic range eliminates many problematic comparisons, such that the average number of difficult or impossible-to-distinguish species pairs from any location was 7.3 when considering all species, or 0.37 when considering only those typically surveyed with camera traps. The greatest diversity of difficult-to-distinguish species was in Arizona and New Mexico, with 57 difficult pairs of species, suggesting the problem scales with overall species diversity. Our results show which species are most readily differentiated by photographic data and which taxa should be identified only to higher taxonomic levels (e.g., genus). Our results are relevant to ecologists, as well as those using artificial intelligence to identify species in photographs, but also serve as a reminder that continued study of mammals through museum vouchers is critical since it is the only way to accurately identify many smaller species, provides a wealth of data unattainable from photographs, and constrains photographic records via accurate range maps. Ongoing specimen voucher collection, in addition to photographs, will become even more important as species ranges change, and photographic evidence alone will not be sufficient to document these dynamics for many species.

Widespread winners and narrow-ranged losers: Land use homogenizes biodiversity in local assemblages worldwide	Tim Newbold|Lawrence N. Hudson|Sara Contu|Samantha L. L.

Scharlemann|Andy Purvis	PLOS Biology	30.07.2020	2018-12-04T00:00:00.000Z	true	true	generic		CHINA|UNITED_KINGDOM|GERMANY|UNITED_STATES		JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2006841	10.1371/journal.pbio.2006841	82b48df5-f553-3de2-8eac-4f4874e9c8cc	Human use of the land (for agriculture and settlements) has a substantial negative effect on biodiversity globally. However, not all species are adversely affected by land use, and indeed, some benefit from the creation of novel habitat. Geographically rare species may be more negatively affected by land use than widespread species, but data limitations have so far prevented global multi-clade assessments of land-use effects on narrow-ranged and widespread species. We analyse a large, global database to show consistent differences in assemblage composition. Compared with natural habitat, assemblages in disturbed habitats have more widespread species on average, especially in urban areas and the tropics. All else being equal, this result means that human land use is homogenizing assemblage composition across space. Disturbed habitats show both reduced abundances of narrow-ranged species and increased abundances of widespread species. Our results are very important for biodiversity conservation because narrow-ranged species are typically at higher risk of extinction than widespread species. Furthermore, the shift to more widespread species may also affect ecosystem functioning by reducing both the contribution of rare species and the diversity of speciesâ€™ responses to environmental changes among local assemblages.

A preliminary model analysis was performed to estimate the likely distribution of wild boar comparing the performance of a presenceâ€only model (bioclim) and presenceâ€background model (MaxEnt). Based on the results of this modelling, locations were identified, notably in Eastern Europe, where more data are required in order to produce more robust model projections of occurrence. This report also outlines the current state of available data collected by ENETWILD (occurrence, hunting bag and density) on wild boar and the development of a model framework that can be used to produce outputs on the yearly density distributions at high resolution of wild boar at a European scale.
